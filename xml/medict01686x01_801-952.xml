          <lb/>under the Emperors Of the middle Ages, signified any thing</p>

          <lb/>which are called <hi>Blattee Byzantiae</hi>, and by the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the

          <lb/>the Library-keeper, in his Lives of the Popes, often men-.
          <lb/><hi>rtisorts Pallia e Blatiio Byxantino</hi>. It appears then, that by the

          <lb/>xaniia, or Byzantian</hi> Purple-fish. AS κογχύλιον, <hi>(Conchylium)</hi>
          <lb/>as well among the <hi>Greeks</hi> as the <hi>Latins</hi>, is sometimes taken
          <lb/>for the Flesh of an _ Oyster, sometimes sor the Shell, so the
          <lb/>Name <hi>os Blatta Byzantia</hi> has by Use been appropriated to the
          <lb/>flinty Cover of the Purpin-fish. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Considered therefore in this respect, the <hi>Blatta Byzantia</hi>
          <lb/>are a. quite different thing from the <hi>Unguis Odoratus</hi> of the
          <lb/>Antients, which was gather'd out Of the <hi>Indian</hi> Marshes, and
          <lb/>for that Reason called by the <hi>Greeks οηξ ’IrJirdur. But Diofcorides</hi>
          <lb/>telis us, that this <hi>Indian</hi> Onyx was like the CoVer of
          <lb/>the Purple-fish: όνυξ ἔστι πῶμα κογχυλίου, όμοιον τῶτῆς πορφύρας,
          <lb/>" The Onyx is the Cover or Lid of a Shell-fish, - like thet of
          <lb/>" the Purple-fish.'’ Let us grant then, that, on account of
          <lb/>the Likeness, the Name of the Purple-fish is justly due, and
          <lb/>may be given, to that <hi>Indian</hi> Shell-fish. All the Difficulty does
          <lb/>not lie here, but in whet <hi>Diofcorides</hi> properly calls the πῶμα
          <lb/>κογχυλίου, so The Cover of the Conchylium, or Shell-fish."
          <lb/>All Our modern Interpreters take it for the Shell Of the Conchylium,
          <lb/>because the Conchylium is empty. <hi>Brafsuvolus</hi> renders
          <lb/>it the Crust and Shell os the Conchylium, <hi>[Crustas et
          <lb/>Conchas Conchyliorum</hi>) which, I am sure, is far wide of the
          <lb/>Truth, and the genuine Signification of the Word πῶμα.
          <lb/>The <hi>Greeks</hi> call the Shell of any sort of Oyster ’Ὁστρακον
          <lb/><hi>{Ostracism</hi>.. Thus <hi>Diofcorides</hi> speaking of Lime: τῶν θαλάττίων
          <lb/>κηρήκων τὰ οστρακα, " The Shells of Sea-whelks.'' Besides,
          <lb/>that <hi>Diofcorides</hi> did not take the Word όνυξ, which, he fays, is
          <lb/>the πῶμα Conchylii, for the whole Shell, appears from his
          <lb/>own Words towards the End of the Chapter, where he fays,
          <lb/>that " The <hi>Conchylium</hi> calcined produced the fame Effects
          <lb/>"aS the Purple-fish and Whelk," ἀυτὸ δὲ τὸ κογχύλιον κμάν
          <lb/>ποιεῖ όσα καὶ ή πορφύρα καὶ ὁ κήρυξ. Therefore the όνυξ. <hi>Unguis,</hi>
          <lb/>is a Part of the Conchyhum, not its whole Inclosure or Shell.
          <lb/>The <hi>Arabians</hi> took it right. <hi>Avicenna's</hi> Words, <hi>adfar althaib,</hi>
          <lb/>by which he expresses the όνυχες ρθρωμά/ίζοντες of <hi>Diofcorides,</hi>
          <lb/>are rendered by <hi>Frusta vel Fragmenta similia Unguibus, qui</hi> Bits
          <lb/>" or Fragments resembling Nails;" for this is the Serise used
          <lb/>hy him in the plural Numher, which in a Very antient Glossary

        <p rend="indent">Concision, incision. Decision, Fragment, Bit.’’ In the
          <lb/>same Glossary <hi>Mukatha</hi> is explained by <hi>decerptum</hi>, "'crops,"
          <lb/>what is cropt or cut off from an entire Body. So here όνυξ
          <lb/>is to be taken for a Piece cut off from the Conchylium, and
          <lb/>for a Part of it, not for the whole Shell; and this is the πῶμα
          <lb/>κογχυλίου of <hi>Diofcorides</hi>, which now comes to be explained.</p>

          <lb/>or wreathed, may, in some measure, be likened to

          <lb/>through which they put forth their Tongue, and take
          <lb/>their Food. They have also a sort of a Cover, at the Part
          <lb/>where the Neck is situated, under which they thrust out their
          <lb/>Tongue to feed, and draw it back as they please. This is

          <lb/>produce Nard, and that - this was the Cause of its Fragrancy,
          <lb/>because it was fed with Nard.;- and yet, in reckoning the Rinds
          <lb/>of this Conchylium, should only mention the <hi>Babylonian</hi>, and

          <lb/>Nard, indeed, is not produced in <hi>Babylon</hi>, nor in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi>
          <lb/>but in <hi>India</hi> about the <hi>Ganges</hi> ; whence it is call’d Γαγτἑτικὴ
          <lb/>νἀρδος, " <hi>Gangetic</hi> Nard.” But what he fays about the nardiserous
          <lb/>Marshes, is Matter of Laughter; for what Author
          <lb/>among the Antients ever told us, that <hi>Indian</hi> Nard grew in
          <lb/>’ Water and Marshes ? <hi>Diofcorides</hi> himself tells us, that it was
          <lb/>- produced on a Mountain of <hi>India</hi> he mentions indeed another
          <lb/>Sort, which grew “ in watery Places,” έφ ὑδατωδών. But
          <lb/>it is one thing to grow in moist and well-water’d Places, and
          <lb/>- another thing to fpring up in the Middle of Marshes and standing
          <lb/>Waters. <hi>Garcias</hi> informs us, that Nard is seldom found
          <lb/><hi>in India</hi> of spontaneous Growth, but that it is always propagated
          <lb/>by-Culture.. <hi>Diofcorides</hi> compiled his Chapter of the
          <lb/><hi>Unguls Oderatus from</hi> two Authors, without considering thet
          <lb/>they contradicted one another ; sot it is impossible to reconcile
          <lb/>the collecting the <hi>Unguis Oderatus</hi> of the Conchylium from the
          <lb/>Marshes of <hi>India</hi>, with the Account of two Kinds of it, one
          <lb/>coming from the <hi>Red Sea</hi>, and another from <hi>Babylon</hi>, differing
          <lb/>in Colour- and Bigners. Nor shall I regard whet may possibly
          <lb/>he pretended, that the <hi>Indian</hi> Ungues may come in Ships by
          <lb/>Way of the <hi>Red Sea</hi>, -and <hi>to Babylon</hi> by Land. This will by
          <lb/>no means bringhirn off; for he mentions only one Kind in the
          <lb/>Beginning, which was found in <hi>India</hi>, and assigns the Cause of
          <lb/>its Fragrancy to its feeding on Nard: Now-it is certain, that
          <lb/>Nard grows no-where but in <hi>India</hi> , besides, he-every-where

        <p rend="indent">I conjecture, therefore; that the true Unguis Odoratos was something

        <p rend="indent">I.  That the Unguis Odoratus seems to have been a fresh,
          <lb/>water Bivalve or Mufcle, for that they staid till the Lakes on the

          <lb/>Bivalves are ever buried in Sand and Mud, and never rise up,
          <lb/>and swim about, and float, as theTurbinate Snails do; to which
          <lb/>fatter ouly the Operculum belongs, and which therefore were

          <lb/>in the Management of a narrow Fortune, and the Prudence,
          <lb/>Tenderness, and Diligence, with which he educated a numerous
          <lb/>Family of nine Children. He was eminentiy shill'd in History

        <p rend="indent">HiS Mother was <hi>Hagar Daelder</hi>, a Tradesman's Daughter
          <lb/>.of <hi>Amsterdam</hi>, from whom he might, perhaps, derive an heTeditary

          <lb/>Very inquisitive, and had obtained a Knowledge of it not common

          <lb/>Learning, and the first Elements of Languages ; in winch he
          <lb/>made such a Proficiency, that he was, at the Age of eleven

        <p rend="indent">At Intervals, to recreate his Mind, and strengthen his Consist

          <lb/>which he continued thro’ all his Lise to love and

        <p rend="indent">The Studies of young <hi>Boerhaave</hi> were, about this Time, interrupted
          <lb/>by an Accident, which deserves a particular Mention,
          <lb/>as it first inclin’d him to that Science, to which he was by Nature
          <lb/>so well adapted, and which he afterwards carried to fo great
          <lb/>Perfection.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the twelfth Year of his <hi>Elgst</hi>, a stubborn, painful, and
          <lb/>malignant Ulcer, broke out upon his Left Thigh ; which, for
          <lb/>near five Years, defeated all the Art of the Surgeons and Physicians,
          <lb/>and not only afflicted him with most excruciating
          <lb/>Pains, but exposed him to such sharp and tormenting Applications,
          <lb/>that the Disease and Remedies were equally insufferable.
          <lb/>Then it was that his own Anguish taught him to compassionate
          <lb/>‘that of others, and his Experience of the Inefficacy of the Me-.
          <lb/>thods then in Use incited him to attempt the Discovery of
          <lb/>others more certain.</p>
        <p rend="indent">He began so practise at least honestly, for he began upon
          <lb/>himself ; and his first Essay was a Prelude to his suture Success;
          <lb/>for, having said aside all the Prescriptions of his Physicians, and
          <lb/>all the Applications of his Surgeons, he at last, by fomenting
          <lb/>the Part with Salt and Urine, effected a Cure. </p>
        <pb n="5"/>
        <p rend="indent">That heinight, on this Occasion, obtain the Assistance of
          <lb/>Surgeons with less Inconvenience and Expence, he was brought
          <lb/>by his Father, at Fourteen, to <hi>Leyden</hi>, and placedin the fourth
          <lb/>Class of the public School, after having been examined by the
          <lb/>Master: Here his Application and Abilities were equally conspicuous.
          <lb/>In six Months; by gaining the first Prine in the fourth
          <lb/>Class, he was raised to the fifth; and in set Months more, upon
          <lb/>the same Proof ofthe Superiority os his ^Genius, rewarded with
          <lb/>another Prize, arid tranflated to the sixth ; from whence it is
          <lb/>usual in six Months inore to he removed to the University.:</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thus did our young Student advance in Learning and Repuration,
          <lb/>when, as he was within View of the University, a
          <lb/>sadden and* unexpected Blow threaten'd to defeat all his Expectations.

        <p rend="indent"><hi>Od</hi> the I2th of <hi>November</hi> in I682. his Father died, arid
          <lb/>left hehind him a Very {lender Provision'lor his Widow and nine
          <lb/>'Children,' of which the eldest was not yet seventeen^ears old.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This was a most afflicting Loss to the young Scholar, whose
          <lb/>Fortune was by no means sufficient to bear the Expences of a
          <lb/>learned Education, and who therefore now‘seem'd to he summoned
          <lb/>by Necessity to some Way os Life more immediately
          <lb/>and certainly lucrative; but with a Resolution equal Io his Abilities,
          <lb/>and a Spirit not to be depress'd or shaken, he determin'd to
          <lb/>break thro* the Obstacles of Poverty, and supply by Diligence
          <lb/>the want of Fortune.</p>
        <p rend="indent">He therefore a/k'd and obtain'd the Consent of his Guardians
          <lb/>to prosecute his Studies as long as his Patrimony would support
          <lb/>him, and. Continuing his wonted Industry, gained another
          <lb/>Prize. -</p>
        <p rend="indent">He was now <hi>to</hi> quit the School for the University, but, on
          <lb/>account of the Weakness yet remaining in his Thigh, was, at
          <lb/>his own Intreaty, continu'd six Months longer under the Care
          <lb/>os his Master, the learn'd <hi>iPyns.chotan</hi>, where he once more was
          <lb/>Honour'd with the Prize.</p>
        <p rend="indent">At his Removal to the University, the same Genius and Industry
          <lb/>met with the fame Encouragement and Applause. The
          <lb/>learned <hi>Triglandius</hi>, one of his Father's Friends, made soon after
          <lb/>Professor os Divinity at <hi>Leyden</hi>, distinguish'd him in a particular
          <lb/>manner, and recommended him to the Friendship of Mr. <hi>Van
          <lb/>Apphen</hi>, in whom he found a generous and constant Patron.</p>
        <p rend="indent">He became now a diligent Hearer of the most celebrated Prolessors,
          <lb/>and made great Advances in all the Sciences, still regulating
          <lb/>his Studies with a View principally to Divinity, for
          <lb/>which he was originally intended by his Father; and for that
          <lb/>Reason he exerted his utmost Application to attain an .exact
          <lb/>Knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Being convinc'd of the Necessity Of mathematical Learning,
          <lb/>he began to study those Sciences in 1687.’ but without , that intense
          <lb/>Industry with which the Pleasure he foundin that <hi rend="u">kind</hi> of
          <lb/>Knowledge induc’d him afterwards to cultivate them.</p>
        <p rend="indent">in I 690. having perform'd the Exercises of the University
          <lb/>with uncommon Reputation, he took his Degree in Philosophy;
          <lb/>and, on that Occasion, discussed the important and arthrous
          <lb/>Question of the distinct Natures of the Soul and Body, with
          <lb/>fuch Accuracy, Perspicuity, and Subtilty, that he entirely confuted
          <lb/>all the Sophistry of <hi>Epicurus, Hobbes</hi>, and <hi>Spinos.a</hi>, and
          <lb/>equally raised the Character of his Piety and Erudition.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Divinity was still his great Employment, and the chief Aim
          <lb/>of all his Studies. He read the Scriptures in their original Lan‘
          <lb/>guages, and, when Difficulties occurr'd, consulted the Interpretations
          <lb/>of the most antient-Fathere, whom he read in Order of
          <lb/>Time, beginning with <hi>Carmens Romanus</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the Perusal of these early Writers, he was struck with
          <lb/>the profoundest Veneration sor the Simplicity and Purity of
          <lb/>their Doctrine, the Holiness of their Lives, and the Sanctity of
          <lb/>the Discipline practised by them ; but, as he descended to the
          <lb/>lower Ages, he found the Peace of Christianity broken by useless
          <lb/>Controversies, and its Doctrines sophisticated by the Subtilties
          <lb/>of the Schools. He found the holy Writers interpreted according
          <lb/>to the Notions of Philosophers, and the Chimeras of
          <lb/>Metaphysicians adopted aS Articles of Faith. He found Difficulties
          <lb/>raised by idle Curiosity, and fomented to Bitterness and
          <lb/>Rancour; He saw the Simplicity os the Christian Doctrine corjrupted
          <lb/>by the private Notions of particular Parties, os winch each
          <lb/>'adhered to its own Philosophy, and Orthodoxy was confined to
          <lb/>the Sect in Power;</p>
        <p rend="indent">Having now exhausted his Fortune in the Pursuit of his
          <lb/>Studies, he found the Necessity of applying to some Profession,
          <lb/>that, without engrossing all his <hi rend="u">Tim</hi>e, <hi rend="u">mig</hi>ht <hi rend="u">enab</hi>le <hi rend="u">him</hi> to support
          <lb/>himself; and, having ob<hi rend="u">tain</hi>'d a very uncommon Knowledge
          <lb/>of the Mathematics, he read Lectures in those Sciences
          <lb/>to a select Number os young Gentlemen <hi rend="u">in</hi> the University.</p>
        <p rend="indent">At length, his Piopenfton to the Study os Physic grew too
          <lb/>violent to he resisted ; and, tho’ he still in<hi rend="u">tended</hi> to <hi rend="u">make</hi> Divinity
          <lb/>the great Employment os his Life, he could not deny <hi rend="u">him-</hi>

        <p rend="indent">In Conjunction with all thefe inquiries, he still purfued his

        <p rend="indent">In this last. Iliness, which was to the last Degree lingering, .
          <lb/>painful, and afflictive, his Constancy and Firmness did not .for- .
          <lb/>sake him. \He neither intermitted the necessary Cares of Life,
          <lb/>nor forgot the proper Preparations for Death. - Though Dejection
          <lb/>and Lowness of Spirit was, as he himself telis uS, Part of
          <lb/>his Distemper ; yet even this, in some measure, gave way to
          <lb/>that Vigour which the Soul receives from a Consciousness of
          <lb/>Innocence.'<space type="tab"> </space>f .</p>
        <p>About three Weeks before hrs Death he received a Visit at his
          <lb/>Country-house from the Rev. Mr. <hi>Schultens</hi>, his intimateFriend,
          <lb/>who found him’sitting without Door, with his Wife, Sister,
          <lb/>‘and Daughter; After the Compliments of Form, the ladies
          <lb/>withdrew, and left them to private Conversation; when <hi>Bocrhaaue</hi>
          <lb/>took Occasion to tell him what <hi rend="u">had</hi> been, during his IIIiness,
          <lb/>the chief Subject of his Thoughts. He had never doubted
          <lb/>of the spiritual and immaterial Nature of the Soul, but declared
          <lb/>that he had lately had a kind of experimental Certainty of the
          <lb/>Distinction between corpores! and thinking Substances, which
          <lb/>mere Reason and Philosophy cannot afford ; and Opportunities
          <lb/>lus contemplating the wonderful and inexplicable Union os Soul
          <lb/>'and.Body, which nothing but long'Sickness can give. This he
          <lb/>illustrated hy :a Description of the Effects which the Infirmities
          <lb/>of his Body had upon this Faculties; which yet they did not so
          <lb/>oppress or Vanquish, but his Soul was always Master of itselsy
          <lb/>'and always resigned to the Pleasure of its Maker.</p>
        <p>He related, 'with great Concern, that once his Patience so
          <lb/>sar gave way to Extremity of Pain, that, after having lain fifteen
          <lb/>Hours in exquisiteIortures, he prayed to God, that he
          <lb/>might be set freethy Death.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Mr. <hi>Schultens</hi>, by way of Consolation, answered. That he
          <lb/>’thought such Wishes, when forced by continued and excessive
          <lb/>Torments, unavoidable in the present State of human Nature ;
          <lb/>that the heft Men, even <hi>Job</hi> himself, were not able to refrain
          <lb/>from such Starts of impatience. This he did not deny, but
          <lb/>.said, " He that loves God, ought to think nothing desirable.
          <lb/>" but what« most pleasing to the supreme Goodness.'' </p>
        <pb n="8"/>
        <p rend="indent">Such were his Sentiments, and such his Conduct, in this State
          <lb/>of Weakness and Pain: As Death approached nearer, he was
          <lb/>fo sar'from Terror or Confusion, that he seemed even less sensible
          <lb/>of Pain, and more chearful under his Torments/ which
          <lb/>continued till the 23d Day of <hi>Septembcr</hi> I738. on winch he
          <lb/>died, between Four and Five in the Morning, in the 70th Year
          <lb/>os his Age.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thus died <hi>Boerhaave</hi>, a Man formed by Nature for great Dee
          <lb/>signs,. and guided. by Religion in the Exertion of his Abilities.
          <lb/>He was of a robust and athletic Constitution of Body, so hardened
          <lb/>by early Severities, and wholsome Fatigue, that he was
          <lb/>insensible. of any Sharpness of Ain, or Inclemency of Weather.He
          <lb/>was tall, and remarkable for extraordinary Strength.
          <lb/>There was in his Air and Motion something rough and artiess,
          <lb/>hut so majestic and great at the same .time, that no Man ever
          <lb/>looked upon him without Veneration, and a kind of tacit Submission
          <lb/>to the Superiority of his Genius.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Vigour and Activity of his Mind sparkled Visibly in his
          <lb/>Eyes, nor was it observed, that any Change of his Fortune, or
          <lb/>Alteration in his Affairs, whether happy or unfortunate, affected
          <lb/>his Countenances</p>
        <p rend="indent">He was always dhearfuj, and desirous of promoting Mirth by
          <lb/>. a facetious and humorous Conversation; he was never soured
          <lb/>by Calumny and Detraction, nor eVer thought it necessary to
          <lb/>confute them ; for <hi>they are Sparks</hi>, said he, <hi>which, if you de
          <lb/>not blow them. Will go out of themselves. \<space type="tab"> </space></hi>/ . .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Yet the took care never to provoke Enemies hy Severity of
          <lb/>Censure; for he never dwelt on the Faults or Defects os others,
          <lb/>and .was so. far from inflaming the Envy of his Rivals by dwelling
          <lb/>on his own Excellencies, that he rarely mentioned himself,
          <lb/>or his Writings.</p>
        <p rend="indent">De was riot to be overaw'd or depress’d by the Presence,
          <lb/>Frowns, or Insolence of great-Men, but persisted on all Occasions
          <lb/>in the right, with a Resolution always present, and always
          <lb/>calm. He was modest, but not timorous ; and firm without
          <lb/>Rudeness. .’ Ἀ</p>
        <p rend="indent">He could, with uncommon Readiness and Certainty, make a
          <lb/>Conjecture of Mens Inclinations and Capacity by their Aspect.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Hrs Method of Life was to study in the Morning and EVen-
          <lb/>Ing, and to allot the Middle of the Day to his public Business.
          <lb/>He rose at Four in the Summer, and Five in Winter. His usual
          <lb/>Exercise was Riding, till, in his latter Years, his Distempers
          <lb/>made it more proper sor him to walk ; when he was weary, he
          <lb/>amused himself with playing on the Violin.</p>
        <p rend="indent">His greatest Pleasure was to retire to his House in the Coutitry,
          <lb/>where he had a Garden of eight Acres, stored with all the
          <lb/>Herbs and Trees which the Climate would bear: Here he used
          <lb/>' to enjoy his Hours unmolested, and prosecute his Studies without
          <lb/>Interruption. ‘»</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Diligence with which he pursued his Studies, is fufficientiy
          <lb/>evident from his Success. Statesmen and Generals may
          <lb/>grow great by unexpected Accidents, and a fortunate Concurrence
          <lb/>of Circumstances, neither procured nor foreseen . by
          <lb/>themselves: But Reputation in the learned World must.be the
          <lb/>. Effect of Industry and Capacity. <hi>Boerhaave</hi> lost none of his
          <lb/>' Hours, but when he had attained one Science, attempted an.
          <lb/>other: He added Physic to Divinity, Chymistry to the Matheinatics,
          <lb/>and Botany to Anatomy. He examined Systems by
          <lb/>Experiments, and formed Experiments into Systems. He nei.ther
          <lb/>neglected the Observations of others, nor blindly submitted
          <lb/>to celebrated Names. He neither thought so highly of himfelf,
          <lb/>as to imagine he could receive no Light from Books; nor so
          <lb/>’meanly, as to believe he could discover nothing hut what was to
          <lb/>be learned from them. He examined the Observations Of other
          <lb/>Men, but trusted only to his own.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Nor was he unacquainted with the Art of recommending .
          <lb/>Truth by Elegance, and embellishing Philosophy with polite '
          <lb/>* Literature ; he knew that but a small Part of Mankind will
          <lb/>sacrifice their Pleasure to then Improvement; and those Au’
          <lb/>thorS who would find many Readers, must endeavour to please
          <lb/>'while they instruct. . : . ’ - . .. - . ς ἐν</p>
        <p rend="indent">He knew the Importance of his own Writings to Mankind ;
          <lb/>and lest he might by a Roughness and Barbarity os Style, tho fre'
          <lb/>quent among Men of great Learning, disappoint his own Intentions,
          <lb/>and make his Labours less useful, he did not neglect
          <lb/>i the Arts of Eloquence and Poetry. Thus was his .lLearning at
          <lb/>. once various and exact, profound and agreeable.</p>
        <p rend="indent">He was not only skilled in the learned Languages, and the
          <lb/>i Tongues in which the Old Testament was written, but was
          <lb/>; able to converse in many of the modern Languages, and to read
          <lb/>" Others which he could not speak. . '</p>

          <lb/>‘ racter, but the second Place; his Virtue was yet much more uncommon
          <lb/>than his Learning? He was an admirable Example of
          <lb/>Temperance, Fortitude, Hnrnility, and Devotion. HiS Piety,
          <lb/>and a religious Sense of his Dependende on God, was the Basis
          <lb/>' of all his Virtues, and the Principle Os his*whole Conduct. He
          <lb/>was too sensible os his Weakness to ascribe any thing to himself,
          <lb/>or to conceive that he could subdue Passion, or withstand
          <lb/>Temptation, by his own naturalPower ; he attributed every good</p>
        <p>Thought, and every laudable Action, to -the Furher’of Grindnest
          <lb/>Being once ashed hy a Friend, who had often admired
          <lb/>his Patience under, great Provocations, whether he knew whet
          <lb/>it was to be angry, and by whet means he had so entirely suppressed
          <lb/>that impetuous and ungovernable Passion; fie answer'd ;
          <lb/>with the utmost Frankness andSineerity, That hewas naturally
          <lb/>quick of Resentment, hut that he had, by daily Prayer, and
          <lb/>meditation, .at length attained to this Mastery over himself
          <lb/>.. As soon as he: rose in theMorning; It was, throughout h.S'
          <lb/>whole Lise, .his daily Practice to retire forari Hour to.private
          <lb/>Prayer and Meditation ; this,, he often told bls Friends, gave
          <lb/>him Spirit and Vigour in the Business of the Day; and this he
          <lb/>therefore commended as the best Role of Life ; for nothing, he
          <lb/>knew, could support the Soul in all Distresses but a Confidence
          <lb/>in the Supreme Being, nor can a steady and rational Magnanimity
          <lb/>flow from any. other Source than a Consciousness of the
          <lb/>Divine Favour.</p>
        <p rend="indent">He asserted on ail Occasions the Divine Authority, and sacred
          <lb/>Efficacy, of the Holy Scriptures; and maintained that by them
          <lb/>alone was taught the Way os Salvation, and that they only could
          <lb/>give Peace of Mind. The Excellency of the Christian Religion
          <lb/>was the frequent Subject of his Conversation. A strict Obedi-ence
          <lb/>to the Doctrine, and a diligent Imitation os the Example;
          <lb/>Of our blessed Saviour, he often declared to be the Foundation
          <lb/>of true Tranquillity. He recommended to his Friends ai careful
          <lb/>Observation of the Precept of <hi>Mosey</hi> concerning, the Love of
          <lb/>God and Man. He worshipped God aS he is in himself, with- ‘
          <lb/>- out attempting to inquire into his Nature. He desired only to
          <lb/>.think of God, what God has reveal'd of himself. There he
          <lb/>stopped, lest by indulging his own Ideas he should form a
          <lb/>Deity from his own Imagination, and commit Sin by falling '
          <lb/>down before him. To the Wall of God be paid an absolute
          <lb/>.Submission,.without endeavouring to discover the Reason of hie
          <lb/>Determinations; and thin he accounted the first and most invi'
          <lb/>olable Duty of a Christian. When he heard os a Criminal con.,
          <lb/>demned to die, he used to think, and often to say. Who cart
          <lb/>tell whether this Man is riot better than I ? Or, if I am better; it
          <lb/>is not to be ascribed to myself, but to the Goodness, of Ged.</p>
        <p rend="indent">So sar was this Man from being made impious by Philosophy;
          <lb/>or vain by Knowledge, or hy Virtue, that he ascribed all bin
          <lb/>Abilities to the Bounty, and all his Goodness to the Grace os
          <lb/>God. May his Example extend its Influence to his Admirers
          <lb/>and Followers l May those who. studythis Writings, imitate his
          <lb/>Life; and those who endeavour after his Knowledge, aspire

          <lb/>Works, which are his Institutes, his Apho<hi rend="u">risms</hi>, and his Chymistry.
          <lb/></p>
        <p rend="indent">His Institutes were designed as littie more than a Syllabus
          <lb/>to his Lectures. They are written in a Very concife and close
          <lb/>Style, but abound in Matter containing all the modern Discoveries
          <lb/>in Anatomy, Physiology, and whatever relates to the
          <lb/>Laws of the Animal Oeconomy, and the Action of Medicines
          <lb/>upon the Body, with considerable Improvements of his
          <lb/>own, which are fpecify'd under their proper Articles. This
          <lb/>Treatise is Very methodical and distinct; but I apprehend it
          <lb/>is utterly unintelligible to any one who is not in some Degree
          <lb/>previousty acquainted with the Subjects Of which he treats.</p>
        <p rend="indent">His Aphorisms are, as he telis us himself, collected from the
          <lb/><hi>Greek</hi> Medicinal Writers, the <hi>Arabians</hi>, and some few of the
          <lb/>Moderns; and his Reasonings are founded on the Structure of
          <lb/>the Parts, and the Laws of Mechanics. I must here observe,
          <lb/>that <hi>Bocrhaave</hi>, to his great Honour, seems to have gone connter
          <lb/>to most Writers of Institutes, and Compilers of Systems.
          <lb/>For they have generally endeavour'd to lead Nature as it were
          <lb/>captive, and make her act conformable to their preconceived
          <lb/>Notions, however Crude and chimerical; imposing Laws upon
          <lb/>the Animal Oeconomy, which have no Reality, and estab<hi rend="u">lishin</hi>g
          <lb/>with great Pains and industry. Sources of Action, which exist
          <lb/>no.where but in their own Imaginations. <hi>Boerhaave</hi>, on the
          <lb/>contrary, was convinced- by daily Experience, and a Fund of
          <lb/>good Sense, that <hi>Greek</hi> Physicians by diligent Observation
          <lb/>had determin'd with great Accuracy, how Nature acts in producing
          <lb/>the Symptoms of Distempers, and her Methods of
          <lb/>relieving her herself, either with or without the Assistance of
          <lb/>Art; and that their Experience had furnish'd them with Very
          <lb/>successful Methods of Cure, The two Points therefore which
          <lb/>he feems to have had perpetually in View were, to establish
          <lb/>on Mechanical Principles, as much as was possible, the
          <lb/>Doctrine of the Antients with respect to the Diagnostics and
          <lb/>Prognostics of Diseases, and shew that they could not he
          <lb/>otherwise than they have represented them.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But the second View is of more Importance than the first.
          <lb/>It heing no less than to demonstrate/ that the Methods of
          <lb/>Cure, pursued hy the.antient Physicians, were generally the
          <lb/>best that could possibly have heen contriv'd with the Materials
          <lb/>they were acquainted with, tho'Tor Reasons to which they
          <lb/>were probably Strangers, This appears to me the distinguishing
          <lb/>Character of <hi>Boerhaave</hi>. And by this he has done almost
          <lb/>as much Service to Physic, as his Predecessors for some Certtitties
          <lb/>had done Mischief. . .</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is greatly to he lamented, that our illustrious Author did
          <lb/>not think proper to publish his Lectures on his Institutes and
          <lb/>Aphorisms, hefore ins Decease. If he had foreseen the fetal
          <lb/>Consequences of such an Omission, I helieVe his Love to
          <lb/>Mankind would have prevailed upon him to have done it, and
          <lb/>thereby prevented the Mischiess ins great Name, and the Reputation
          <lb/>os his Lectures, may possibly do in the World.
          <lb/>That I may explain my Meaning, I must observe, that inis
          <lb/>the Misfortune of the <hi>English</hi> to he Very little used to converse
          <lb/>in <hi>Latin</hi>, tho' perhaps no People ip the World understand
          <lb/>it hetter. Add to this, that as we pronounce <hi>Latin</hi> in a
          <lb/>different manner from all other Nations, our Ears are not
          <lb/>accustom'd to the foreign.Accent. Hence Foreigners with
          <lb/>Difficulty understand us, and, on the other hand, it is impossible
          <lb/>' for ns to <hi rend="u">take</hi> their Meaning, especially in long Discourses,
          <lb/>with that Degree of Exactness, which Subjects of
          <lb/>Importance require; and indeed it is no easy Matter to take
          <lb/>the entire Sense Of long Discourses, tho' deliver'd in the Languages.we
          <lb/>are best acquainted with. This is the'Reason, that
          <lb/>many of his Pupils, who have only attended his Lectures for
          <lb/>two or three Years, have frequentiy mistaken his Meaning,
          <lb/>and held their Own Errors in an equal Degree of Veneration
          <lb/>with the genuine Doctrine Of their Professor; and have imprudentiy
          <lb/>neglected to set themselves right,by examining the Sources
          <lb/>from whence <hi>Bocrhaave</hi> himself drew his Treasures; sometimes
          <lb/>perhaps, because they imagined the Authority of their
          <lb/>Professor render’d it superfluous; and sometimes, hecause they
          <lb/>were Strangers to the Languages in which the best Medicinal
          <lb/>Authors wrote; thus either out of Choice or Necessity taking
          <lb/>a more easy, tho' less certain Way to Knowledge, than <hi>Bocrhaave</hi>
          <lb/>either advised, or thought proper to pursue himself. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">That this has been really the Case, the spurious Works, attributed
          <lb/>to <hi>Bocrhaave</hi> by his Scholars, are glaring Evidences;
          <lb/>amongst which, his Method of studying Physic, as I think it
          <lb/>is called, deserves some Notice, heing a crude and injudicious
          <lb/>Performance, and in a great many Instances contradictory to
          <lb/>the Sentiments of <hi>Boerhaave</hi>, on the Subjects there treated;
          <lb/>and, as I remember, it recommends some Authors who never
          <lb/>wrote. Or even existed. In the same Rank is the <hi>Praxis</hi></p>
        <p><hi>Medica</hi>, printed in five Volumes in <hi>Holland</hi>, tho’ the Title
          <lb/>telis us at <hi>Padua</hi>, in the Presace we are informed, that
          <lb/>many Of his Auditors took his Lectures in Writing; that
          <lb/>these were carefully compar'd, and hence this Work was
          <lb/>compiled. Yet, notwithstanding all this Care, there are not
          <lb/>many Pages without some enormous Error, nor even Sentences
          <lb/>without false <hi>Latin</hi> ; so littie did they understand either
          <lb/>then Professor, Or their Subjects..</p>
        <p rend="indent">With respect to his Chymistry, it may he justly said, that
          <lb/>his Theory is more philosophical, exact, and full, and his ProCefles
          <lb/>more methodical and regular, than those of any preceding
          <lb/>Author on the Subject. It is remarkable, that in this
          <lb/>Work he has made many Chymical Operations subservient to
          <lb/>the establishing several important Doctrines of the Antients,
          <lb/>and to the Confirmation Of their Practice. I shall concludo
          <lb/>with remarking, that this Work alone would have been suf-.
          <lb/>ficient to raise the Character Of any other Man ; but is, hewever,
          <lb/>that in which <hi>Bocrhaave</hi> shines much less than in his
          <lb/>Institutes and Aphorisms, the last of which is, perhaps, more
          <lb/>useful than any One Book written upon Physic, and has had the
          <lb/>Honour- of being transtated into <hi>Arabic</hi>, as is said,, by tho

        <p rend="indent">The Choice of proper Materials for <hi>z Bolus</hi> is regulated by
          <lb/>the following Considerations.</p>
        <p rend="indent">A due Cohesion, Softness, and an equable Mixture, are highly

          <lb/>a <hi>Bolus</hi>.</p>
        <p>For this Reason dry Substances, or such as are liquid, are
          <lb/>not by themselves proper sor this Purpose; but some Ingredients
          <lb/>. of a soft and glutinous Quality must be interposed, hefore the
          <lb/>"due Consistence of a <hi>Bolus</hi> can be produced.</p>
        <p>Most soft Substances must also be inspissated by the Addition</p>
        <p>of some dry ingredients, for the Formation Of a 2?o/us4yef
          <lb/>some of them are of themselves sufficient for this Purpose, such
          <lb/>as the thicker Conserves, Electuaries, and Rohe These may
          <lb/>thereforehe used by way of a simple <hi>Bolus</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">All the Ingredients of a <hi>Bolus</hi> ought to he os shclr a Nature,
          <lb/>as to be capable of being mix'd up, and form'd into an equable
          <lb/>Composition.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Acrid Substances, fuch as are offensive either by their Smell
          <lb/>or Taste, and fuch as are Viscid, are more properly exhibited in
          <lb/>, the Form of a <hi>Bolus</hi>, than in that of Powders; since, in the
          <lb/>former Shape, their disagreeable Qualities are much hetter conceal’d
          <lb/>than in the latter ; for which Reason the Form of a <hi>Boltes</hi>
          <lb/>is the most proper Vehicle for the more strong and drastic Preparations
          <lb/>of Mercury.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is proper to divide pinguious Substances, Balsams, and potable
          <lb/>Ointments, by mixing them with Sugar, or some other dry
          <lb/>. Ingredients, that they may be the more easily swallow'd down,
          <lb/>and dissolved in the Stomach.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Alcaline, fix'd, and Volatile Salts, and all other Substances
          <lb/>which soon become liquid, are Very improperly made ingredients
          <lb/>in a <hi>Bolus</hi>, which is intended to he kept for any considerable
          <lb/>Time; since, by their Colliquation, the due Consistence of tho ’
          <lb/><hi>Bolus</hi> is lost, and its Virtues destroy'd by their Exhalation.</p>
        <p rend="indent">For this Reason Substances which produce an Effervescence,
          <lb/>or easily ferment when mix'd together, are highly improper for
          <lb/>; the Formation of a <hi>Bolus</hi>, Unless the Patient is to use it immediately
          <lb/>after it is prepar'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Number of Ingredients in a <hi>Bolus</hi> ought scarce ever to
          <lb/>exceed three or four.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The most usual Order Observed in prescribing the Ingredients
          <lb/>.of a <hi>Bolus</hi>, is, first, to specify the Quantity of the <hi>Excipient ;</hi>
          <lb/>then the Quantity of the <hi>Excipienda</hi>, Or dry Ingredients, is to
          <lb/>be determin'd; then that Of the Liquids; and lastly, if there is
          <lb/>any more Of the <hi>Excipient</hi> to be added, at the Apothecary's
          <lb/>Discretion, that Circumstance is to he mention’d..</p>
        <p>The Dose of a <hi>Bolus</hi> may he extended from one Dram to.
          <lb/>One Dram and an half, or two Drams ; but is. not rashly to bin
          <lb/>augmented heyond the last-mention'd Quantity, unless when
          <lb/>the Materials of the <hi>Bolus</hi> are of a considerable specific Gravity,,
          <lb/>or when the Patient can take them without Reluctance or Uneasiness
          <lb/>; but the Dose ought scarcely to exceed a Dram,, if the
          <lb/>Ingredients are light. For this Reason, when the Quantity of
          <lb/>the Ingredients must exceed these Bounds, before, it prove an
          <lb/>effectual Dose, it is better to divide the Mass into several <hi>Boluses</hi>,
          <lb/>than to ehoak and disqust the Patient by one thet is unconscionably
          <lb/>and extravagantly large; for as Smallness of Bulk
          <lb/>as a great Recommendation to a Powder, it is much more so to
          <lb/>a <hi>Bolus</hi>, so that, im this respect, we can scarce err, tho’ the
          <lb/>. Quantity of the <hi>Bolas</hi> should scarce exceed a Scruple.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Number of <hi>Bolases</hi> made at a time, is, for the most
          <lb/>part. Only one or two, and rarely three or four Doses, unless
          <lb/>when they are <hi>stp</hi> be taken at Very short Intervals; for, when ’
          <lb/>they are divided hy the Apothecary, they readily become too
          <lb/>dry, Or are melted down, when kept for any Considerable
          <lb/>time. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">The mutual Proportion Of the Ingredients is to be determin'd
          <lb/>-by their Consistence, and their Efficacy; so that the same Proc
          <lb/>portion is not to be observed promiscuously in the Composition
          <lb/>.Of all Bososes, J. .-, EEsoEss .. . ς Ἕ . ..</p>

          <lb/>.he mix'd must he determin'd by the Quantity pf each, which

        <p>small Eggs, hatched by the genial Heat of the Sun, in the Spring

          <lb/>from its Coat in the Form of a Butterfly, with four Wings ;
          <lb/>and after a Copulation, which lasts for three Days, and proves
          <lb/>immediately mortal to the Male, the Female lays a considerable

          <lb/>and perpetual Motion os their Fluids, do, by that Very means,
          <lb/>continually lose some of their Parts, and, consequently, stand

        <p rend="indent">Tin's Supply or Reparation is advantageoufly made by Aliments,

          <lb/>and transforming themselves into Blood and Juices. Bus,
          <lb/>of the several kinds' of Aliment, <hi>Bread</hi> is the principal and
          <lb/>most considerable ; for, according to <hi>Isidorus</hi>, the <hi>Latin</hi> Word
          <lb/><hi>Panes</hi>, which signifies <hi>Bread</hi>, is derived from the <hi>Greek</hi> Word .

        <p rend="indent">For 'tis certain, that the Fluids of our BedieS are composed

          <lb/>Salt, Mucilage, Earth, Water, and other Principles of a like
          <lb/>Nature.. The like Elements are contain’d in Bread; for, upon
          <lb/>Distillation, it yields an oleous, and somewhat, acid. Spirit,
          <lb/>which, besides other Substances, speedily dissolves Coral, and,
          <lb/>by a previous Digestion, produces a reddish Tincture, which is
          <lb/>a Medicine of considerable .Efficacy. Bread also yields a large

          <lb/>That it contains subtil spirituous Parts, of a comforting Qua- .

        <p rend="indent">This kind of Bread was always highly esteemed, heth for

          <lb/>Qualities of <hi>BonpournickeL</hi> 'Tis remarkable that the
          <lb/><hi>LFestphalians</hi> are rarely attack’d by acute Fevers, and those

          <lb/>and a certain malignant Colliquation of the Blond, and of the
          <lb/>Elements or Principles of which it is composed. But the
          <lb/>Diseases which rage among them are of a cold and chronical
          <lb/>Nature, a Circumstance to he ascrib'd to the Groflness of
          <lb/>their Food, and Hardness .of. their. Diet: For, when but a
          <lb/>small Quantity of fuch Aliments as are disposed and prepared
          <lb/>for a fpeedy Corruption is taken, the Humours undergo a flow
          <lb/>’ and less violent Fermentation.: Hence an Excess of Heat is
          <lb/>prevented by the Cohesion of the Viscid Parts. Nor can the

          <lb/>the masterly Turn of Genius; the Evenness of Temper, and
          <lb/>the happy Judgment of transacting Business, with which the
          <lb/><hi>Westphalians</hi> are peculiarly blessed, as also these Promotions in

          <lb/>the Natives, are Circumstances to be ascribed partly to their
          <lb/>Education, and partly to their Method of living. They are
          <lb/>highly qualified for Labour and ’ industry,, to which. they are

          <lb/>in the honest Employments of Life, the Sheds of Vice, and
          <lb/>the Exorbitance os lawless Passions, are check'd in due Time.
          <lb/>And the Method of living used by the <hi>IViestphalians</hi> courributes
          <lb/>not a littie to the Production of this happy Effect. <hi>Aristotle,
          <lb/>Lib. i. Pol</hi>. 3. judicioufly observes, that a Diversity of
          <lb/>Food and Aliment produces a proportionable Diversity in the
          <lb/>-Lives and Morals of. Men; nor is this asserted. without a
          <lb/>. Reason. Since there is a continual Commerce, and an innmate
          <lb/>Union hetween the Soul and the Body, such as are/the
          <lb/>State and Motion of what we call the animal Spirits, fuch also
          <lb/>will he the Inclinations, Thoughts, Operations of the
          <lb/>Mind, and Morals. But this is a Truth so well known to
          <lb/>Physicians, and consumed by Arguments so strong and irrefragable,
          <lb/>that it does not, on this Occasion, stand in need of a
          <lb/>further Illustration.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Nor can it he said, that the gross Fond used by the <hi>Westphalians</hi>
          <lb/>generates gross Spirits; for, by labour and Motion,
          <lb/>the Viscid Particles are fufficientiy divided, and,' aS it were,
          <lb/>prepar'd in such a-manner, as not only to increase the Bulk of
          <lb/>the solid Parts, by a closer Union and Adhesion to the Tubes,
          <lb/>het also generates fufficientiy firm Spirits, which, as they are
          <lb/>not fluctuating and inconstant,, render People sit for bearing
          <lb/>the most obstinate Labours .both Of the Body and Mind ; and,
          <lb/>the' their Blood is somewhat cold, - yet their animal Spirits are
          <lb/>ομά sufficiently active Quality. It is obvious, that an-intestine
          <lb/>Spirit, which resides in the Pores os any Fluid, must he
          <lb/>confin’d:by the Pressure of the thick and rigid Parts, and of</p>
        <p>course become less subject to Dissipation ; so that the spirituous
          <lb/>Parts, heing forc'd to the Centre, and render'd stronger by a
          <lb/>mutual Union, are possessed of an uncommon Force and
          <lb/>Energy’.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But ’tis not to he denied, that this gross Food is less safe
          <lb/>and salutary, for such aS have the Misfortune of weakly Constitutions,
          <lb/>or these who live a quiet and idle Life, or are not accustoin'd
          <lb/>to Labour. Hence <hi>Hippocrates, de Medicina prise.</hi>
          <lb/>justly observes, " That the stronger Aliments, is subdued by
          <lb/>" Nature, are excellent Nourished; is not, they produce
          <lb/>" Pains, and cold Diseases." And <hi>Celsus</hi> informs us, " Thet
          <lb/>" the stronger Foods are not easily concocted; but that, when
          <lb/>" concocted, they nourish more than other Aliments." So
          <lb/>that Labour and Motion are absolutely necessary sor those
          <lb/>who use strong Aliments. Athletic Bedies, and such aS are
          <lb/>accustom'd to Labour and Exercise, receive a more solid
          <lb/>Nourishment than those who are habituated to a calm and idle
          <lb/>Lise, in whom the Nutrition, and the Fat produc’d by is,
          <lb/>are generally suspected of heing faulty ; for 'tis the Motion
          <lb/>and Circulation of the Blood, which by its internal Attrition,
          <lb/>and elastic Force, resolves, subdues, deterges, and converts
          <lb/>the Particles of the Aliments into the Substance os our Bodies;
          <lb/>whereas Rest destroys Nutrition, and generates Obstructions,
          <lb/>which prove a fruitful Source of .Diseases, and render the Ge.
          <lb/>runs flow and fluctuating.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From what has been said, I think, it evidently appears, that
          <lb/>the <hi>Westphalian Bonpourniekel</hi> is or a highly nourishing .Quality;
          <lb/>and that this firm and strong Species os Aliment, by
          <lb/>which heth their Bedies and Minds are recruited, may be more
          <lb/>safely used, and produce more salutary Effects in these People,
          <lb/>who are accustom'd to Labour, than a more delicate Diet can
          <lb/>‘ in those who are habituated to Idleness. Besides, if we will
          <lb/>but take the Pains to put this Matter to the Tost of Reason,
          <lb/>many satisfactory Prooss of the Excellency of the <hi>Westphalian</hi>
          <lb/>Bread occur; for the Nature and Qualities of this gross furfuraceous
          <lb/>Bread, are widely different from those of that which
          <lb/>is made of the finest Meal. The coarse <hi>lPestphalian</hi> Bread,
          <lb/>upon Distillation, yields a very large Quantity os an empyreu-'
          <lb/>Inatic inflammable Oil. Bread indifferently fine, such aS that,
          <lb/>commonly called <hi>Second Bread</hi>, yields a moderate Quantity
          <lb/>of a similar Oil: But Bread os the finest Flour yields, a Very
          <lb/>small Quantity, or rather none at all os it. Besides, Bran
          <lb/>itself, upon Distillation, yields a large Quantity of Oil, produced,
          <lb/>in my Opinion, from the herd external Hulls, which is '
          <lb/>continually acted upon hy the Warmth of the ambient Atmosphere.
          <lb/>Now 'tis Very well known, that a distill'd Oil is
          <lb/>an active Principle, highly agreeable to our .Constitutions, suited
          <lb/>to the Mass os Blood; a Balsam, as it were, to the Humours,
          <lb/>and a faithful Guardian os a due and natural Temperament.
          <lb/>The Blood Itself,' upon Distillation, yields an inflammable Oil;
          <lb/>and the more it partakesof this oleaginous Principle, the greater
          <lb/>Strength it supplies, and the more effectually it preserves Lise
          <lb/>and Health. That distill'd Oils are the Repository, and, as it
          <lb/>were, the Matrix of a Volatile Salt, with which the animal
          <lb/>Kingdom abotmds, is a Truth sufficiently known to those who
          <lb/>have any tolerable Acquaintance with Chymistry. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">From what has been said, we may easily see, how much
          <lb/><hi>Bonpourniekel</hi> is preferable to other Kinds os Bread.: It may
          <lb/>justly he called a medicinal Aliment, since, hesides that Quality
          <lb/>by which it is so friendly to our Constitutions, it is possessed of
          <lb/>another, by which. it. remarkably restores Strength, corrects a
          <lb/>moist Intemperies, dries, defends from Putrefaction, and recruits
          <lb/>the spent and dissipated Spirits: For. which Reason it may he ex- .
          <lb/>hibited as a Medicine, in Cases where Strength is lost, where
          <lb/>the Force and due Texture of the Bleed is destroy'd, and where
          <lb/>a Dissipation of Spirits is dreaded, either in Broth impregnated
          <lb/>with Wine, Sugar, and Cinnamon, or in its own distfl'd Water
          <lb/>of a highly sweet Taste, which is excellent in Loss of
          <lb/>Strength ,and phthisical and hectical Disorders. I need not,on this
          <lb/>Occasion, mention its singular Use, when apply'd externally in

          <lb/>to he found in other Bread, fince, notwithstanding the Coarseness
          <lb/>of its Texture, it renders the Belly soluble. This Virtue
          <lb/>in coarse Bread- was long ago observed by <hi>Hippocrates</hi>, who
          <lb/>affirms, " Thet Bread made of unsifted Meal is purgative,
          <lb/>" whereas that which is purer, is proportionably less so ; and
          <lb/>" that which is purest of all, is so. far from operating in this

          <lb/>that this purgative Quality is to be ascribed to the rigid Texture
          <lb/>and Figure of the Bran, which proves a quick and continual
          <lb/>Stimulus to 'the small intestinal Fibres, to perform their excretory
          <lb/>Motion;Tor, according to <hi>Galea</hi>, Bran is possess’d of a

          <lb/>of coarse Meal are excellently q<hi rend="u">ualifi</hi>ed for keeping the Belly

        <p>excellent for restoring Strength, and recruiting the homogeneous

          <lb/>of Saffron, one Dram : Let the Whole be distrain together

          <lb/>is expressed, heing no other than that by which Gold is solder'd.
          <lb/>But <hi>Tseheb</hi> is put for <hi>Deheb</hi>, for this is <hi>Avicennests</hi> Word

          <lb/>has these Words, <hi>et dicitur Capistrum Auri, " and it</hi> is called

          <lb/>tion or Soldering of Gold." <hi>Avicenna</hi> uses the Veth everywhere
          <lb/>as signifying to conglutinate and conjoin separate Parts,
          <lb/>in the same Sense as the- <hi>Greeks</hi> use συγκολλῳν and κολλῳν-.

          <lb/>the old Interpreter, who mistook it for the other; and
          <lb/>indeed it would be absurd to call Cbrysocolla, which is the
          <lb/>Cause of the Cohesion and ConglutinationOf Gold to Gold,

          <lb/>" find the Water partiy evaporated, and the Salt of the Borax .
          <lb/>" crystallized; that they took these Crystals out of that sat

          <lb/>we consider the two opposite Planes, which may reciprocally serve
          <lb/>for a Base, we shall perceive a small Side of that Plane flatten’d
          <lb/>throughout its whole Length ; and sometimes also the acute
          <lb/>.adjacent Angle, and the two Sides, one in each Plane, thus flatten'd,
          <lb/>are so situated, as to be diametrically opposite. Though

          <lb/>Dram. It is thought by some to have a specific, emmenagogical,
          <lb/>and expulsive Virtue, which may probably be derived from

          <lb/>hundred and sixty-nine; or three hundred and fifty-five, or
          <lb/>three hundred and fifty Years before Christ; AS in this Phy-r

          <lb/>who was hern at <hi>Vircna</hi>, and died in <hi>Asia</hi>, whither he
          <lb/>had gone to fight. AS this Author had a Turn for Poetry,
          <lb/>he cloathed Botany in Numbers so agreeable and soft, as to deserve
          <lb/>the Approbation of <hi>squid</hi>. -. See .dEedILIUS MAC ER-</p>
        <p rend="indent">Next appear'd <hi>Julius Bafsus</hi>, and <hi>Sextius Niger</hi>, who, tho’
          <lb/>both <hi>Romans</hi>, yet wrote in <hi>Greek</hi> concerning Plants. These
          <lb/>Authors have but littie Regard paid them by <hi>Diofcorides</hi>, a
          <lb/>littie before whose Age, or that of <hi>Pliny, Salrnasius</hi> thinks
          <lb/>they liv'd. - <hi rend="sup">e</hi></p>
        <p rend="indent">But hitherto Botany feerns only to haVe been, as it were, in
          <lb/>its Infancy, till <hi>Diofcorides</hi> arose, who, by. his Industry and
          <lb/>Diligence, surpassed all who had gone hefore him. . He was
          <lb/>born at <hi>Anazarba</hi>, a City of <hi>Cilicia</hi>, afterwards called <hi>Cas.area
          <lb/>Augusta</hi>. He is commonly distinguished from the others of
          <lb/>his Name by the Epithet <hi>Pedaceus</hi>, which <hi>Photius</hi> without any
          <lb/>Reason supposes to be bestow'd on him from his Country. In
          <lb/>some Manuscripts the Epithet is read <hi>Pedantus</hi>, and 'tis pmtended,
          <lb/>That <hi>Diofcorides</hi> receiv'd that Part of his Name from
          <lb/>the <hi>Pedstnian Family</hi>, aS other Foreigners did from the <hi>Roman</hi>
          <lb/>Families into which they marriedl But <hi>Lambecius</hi> was probably
          <lb/>in the Right, when he supposed, that this Epithet was bestow'd
          <lb/>on him, because he was the Son of <hi>oss&amp;Pedanius</hi> or
          <lb/><hi>Pedicinius</hi>, as that Author would have it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From the Works of <hi>Diofcorides</hi> it plainly appears, that he
          <lb/>was contemporary with <hi>Licinius Basseus</hi>,. who in- Conjunction
          <lb/>with <hi>Crassus Frugi</hi> had been Consul under <hi>Ncro</hi>. But the’
          <lb/>Time in which he flourish'd is a Point so much controverted,:
          <lb/>and so littie capable os being fix'd, that it would be a Task
          <lb/>both tedious and useless to attempt it. In his Works he has.
          <lb/>mention’d about six hundred Plants, four hundred and ten of
          <lb/>which he has either describ'd or compar’d with fuch as were
          <lb/>better and more universally known, but of the rest he has only.
          <lb/>given us the Names and Virtues.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Soon aster <hi>Diofcorides</hi> appear'd <hi>Lucius Junius Moderatus.
          <lb/>Columella</hi>. He was born at <hi>Cadiz in Andalusia</hi>, and the Time
          <lb/>tin which he liv'd may be determin'd from his having been
          <lb/>contemporary with the <hi>Senecas</hi>, and his quoting <hi>Lucius</hi> the
          <lb/>Philosopher as then alive. Other memorable Incidents concur
          <lb/>to render us sufficiently certain as to the Time in which heflourish'd;
          <lb/>sor he was the intimate Acquaintance of <hi>Gallio,</hi>
          <lb/>and wrote his Work aster the Consulship of <hi>Lucius Volusius.</hi>
          <lb/>We have only thirteen Books of his <hi>de Re Rustica</hi>, and one <hi>de
          <lb/>Arboribus</hi>, the' C^Worusattributes sixteen to him. In the first
          <lb/>Chapter of his first Book he enumerates not only the <hi>Roman</hi>, but
          <lb/>also the other foreign Authors who had wrote upon Agriculture
          <lb/>before him. The delicate and polite Turn of his Language, together
          <lb/>with his Learning, and the Force os his Genius, Justly
          <lb/>calis for our Admiration. In his Poem intituled <hi>Hortulus</hi>, the
          <lb/>Numbers are soft, harmonious, and unsullied with that unmeaning
          <lb/>Pomp of Words, winch is the Reproach of Language,
          <lb/>and the common Bane of theill-sorm'd and luxuriant Genius.
          <lb/>But, among all the <hi>Romans</hi>, none seems to have made more
          <lb/>furprifing Advances in Botany than <hi>Plenius Secundus</hi>. In his'
          <lb/>History of the World, which he dedicated to the Emperor
          <lb/><hi>Vespasian</hi>, or, according to others, to <hi>Titus</hi>, he treats of Plants
          <lb/>in an historical, philosophical, medicinal, rural, and magical
          <lb/>Light. This, according to <hi>Cefner</hi>, is his Design from the
          <lb/>twelfth to the twenty-seventh Book. His Work consists in
          <lb/>all of thirty-seven Books, which contain a great Part of the
          <lb/>Writings of <hi>Diofcorides</hi>, whom he no-where quotes, having
          <lb/>in all Probabiity used the Very same Authors, from whom
          <lb/>that Author had made his Collections. . He also translated several
          <lb/>Tilings from <hi>Theophrastuses</hi> History os Plants, and is
          <lb/>thought to have been no Very happy Tranflator, however bright
          <lb/>his Genius might be in other respects. The precise Time in
          <lb/>which he liv’d is much disputed: However,'tis, I think, generally
          <lb/>agreed, that he flourish’d pretty near the Time os <hi>Diofcorides</hi>.
          <lb/>He is by some censur'd as wanting some of the
          <lb/>Qualifications most necessary for producing a Botanist, whilst
          <lb/>* others are so blindly devoted to his Character, as to believe
          <lb/>him infallible.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The next of the <hi>Romans</hi> who distinguished himself in this
          <lb/>Way, was the illustrious <hi>Palladius Rutilius Taurus AEmilianus,</hi>
          <lb/>tho' he is more properly to be class'd among the <hi>Geoponici,
          <lb/>.Cato, Parro</hi>, and <hi>Columella</hi>. He wrote fourteen Books de
          <lb/><hi>Re Rustica</hi>. According to <hi>Ludouicus Vives</hi>, he wrote in a
          <lb/>pure and elegant Style, except that some Words and Phrases are
          <lb/>peculiar to the Time in which he lived. <hi>Johannes Jucundus
          <lb/>. os Virma</hi>, in <hi>Pref. Lib. de Re.Rustica</hi>, gives him an ample,
          <lb/>and at the same time a just Character in the following Words.
          <lb/>" When, says he, amongst Other Books' of Agriculture, I</p>
        <p><hi><hi rend="sup">U</hi> read</hi> the Works of <hi>Cota, Farro, Columella, and Palladius,
          <lb/>“ I</hi> could not help being charm'd with the delightful Study ; .
          <lb/>" for I imagin'd I was transported to the Country, placed in
          <lb/>" some agreeable Village, and leading the calm and blissful
          <lb/>" Life of <hi>Marcus Curius</hi>, and <hi>Lucius isuinlius Cincinnatus ;</hi>"
          <lb/>the former of whom, alter having triumph'd over the <hi>Sam..
          <lb/>" nites</hi>, the <hi>Sabines</hi>, and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>, retir'd to the Country to
          <lb/><hi rend="sup">Ci</hi> spend the Remains of a glorious Life, where, having a large
          <lb/>"Quantity of Gold brought him by the <hi>Samnites</hi>, he heave"
          <lb/>ly refused the magnificent Presens, and told them, <hi>his
          <lb/>" Grandeur did not consist in the actual Pessefsun of Gold, but
          <lb/>" in ruling over those who possessed. it</hi>.” And the other, being
          <lb/>created Dictator, was honourably invited to leave the Country’,'
          <lb/>and take his Place in the Senate.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From these Accounts 'tis plain, that the Diligence and Industry
          <lb/>of the <hi>Romans</hi> were more employ'd in cultivating Agriculture
          <lb/>than Botany; in which they were surpassed by the
          <lb/><hi>Greeks</hi>, amongst whom the most considerable, who applsid to
          <lb/>the Study os natural Things, was <hi>Claudius Galenus</hi>, who/next
          <lb/>to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>, was justly accounted the greatest Ornament of
          <lb/>anti ent Medicine. . He was hern at <hi>Pergamus</hi>, a most flourish- ing
          <lb/>City of <hi>Asia</hi>, about the Year of Christ I33. under the
          <lb/>Reign <hi>os</hi> the Emperor. <hi>Adrian</hi>, and flourish'd under <hi>Antonius
          <lb/>Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Antoninus,. Commodus, Pertinax, Didius
          <lb/>Julianus</hi>, and <hi>Septimius Severus</hi>. He died under the’
          <lb/>Reign of <hi>Caracalla</hi>, aster having lived, according to <hi>Suidas,</hi>
          <lb/>seventy, according to <hi>Laertius</hi>, eighty-seven, according to
          <lb/>others, ninety-eight, or an hundred and five Years. He was
          <lb/>a curious and indefatigable Inquirer into the Virtues and Qualities
          <lb/>of natural Bodies,, with which View he undertook several
          <lb/>Voyages. He went, for Instance, into <hi>Palestine</hi>, in order
          <lb/>to get acquainted with the Opobalsamum and Bitumen; he
          <lb/>sailed into the Bland of <hi>Lemnos</hi>, that he might discover whether
          <lb/>the Accounts he had receiv'd os the <hi>Lornnian</hi> Earth weretrue
          <lb/>or false. He Visited <hi>Cyprus</hi>, in order to take a View of
          <lb/>the celebrated Mines of that Country. He also travelled into
          <lb/><hi>Cilicia, Phoenicia, Crete, Egypt</hi>, and several other Countries,.
          <lb/>to enrich his Mind with a proper Store of useful Observations.
          <lb/>He has treated os the Virtues of about lour hundred and forty
          <lb/>Plants, in the sixth, seventh, and eighth Books os his Trea-
          <lb/><hi>tise, de Simplicium Medicamentorum Facultatibus</hi>, hesides many
          <lb/>more, which he has casually describ'd on different Occasions.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I now proceed to those whe aster <hi>Galen’s</hi> Time apply'tithemselves
          <lb/>to the <hi>Materia Medica</hi>. The first os these whe

          <lb/>Favour he had so effectually gain'd, as to he appointed Quaestor
          <lb/>os <hi>Constantinople</hi> by him. He wrote many Things eoncerhing
          <lb/>simple and compound Medicines; but stole most of
          <lb/>his Works from <hi>Galen</hi>, except some foolish and trifling Things
          <lb/>he has added of his own. - ’ .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Next appear'd <hi>Aetius</hi>, distinguish'd by the Epithet <hi>Amidenus</hi>,

          <lb/>has written pretty much in the same manner with <hi>Oribasius,</hi>
          <lb/>fince like him he has borrow'd a great many Things from other
          <lb/>Authors. <hi>Castellanus</hi> seems to give him a favourable Character,

          <lb/><hi>Oribasius</hi> explain'd, and <hi>Paulus AEgineta</hi> inlarg'd.
          <lb/>This Author flourished in the Year os Christ three hundred

        <p rend="indent">But <hi>Ges.ncr</hi>, tho' a severe Censurer of these three Authors,
          <lb/>yet seems to have .entertain'd more favourable Notions os the

          <lb/>the <hi>Materia Medica</hi>, during many Years cultivated only by the
          <lb/><hi>Greeks</hi>, was at last so considerably enriched by the <hi>Arabians</hi>, that a
          <lb/>great part of the Medicines now in Use are to be ascribed to
          <lb/>them. They receiv'd Botany, as well as all the other Branches

        <p rend="indent">I now come to <hi>fohn</hi> and <hi>Caspar Bauhine</hi>, two Brothers,

          <lb/>Botany, that the smallest Herb is hardly mention'd without, at
          <lb/>the same time, mentioning the Name affix'd to it by them.
          <lb/>They were bom at <hi>Basil</hi>, but their Father was a Native of
          <lb/><hi>Frances</hi> Notwithstanding the Learning and industry of these
          <lb/>two Brothers, they seem to have undertaken a Talk to which
          <lb/>they were by no means equal; for each of them proposed to
          <lb/>write an universal History of Plants. But as <hi>Gefncr</hi>, in one of
          <lb/>his Epistles to <hi>Fuchsius</hi>, well observes, one Man is not at all
          <lb/>sufficient for carrying on so extensive a Design, fince there are
          <lb/>numberless Species of Plants, each Of which a single Man must
          <lb/>he an entire Stranger to, on account of the Diversity of Cli-mates.
          <lb/>But if different Men, in different Climates, would
          <lb/>oblige the World with their Observations, there is a Possibility
          <lb/>of an universal History of this kind being some time or other
          <lb/>produc'd by a masterly Hand. The' it were to he wish'd, that
          <lb/>a Work of this Nature should appear in out own Age, yet we
          <lb/>have no Reason to expect it; because, from the Descriptions of
          <lb/>the Plants already known, we can neither infallibly discover
          <lb/>then Species, nor reduce them to their proper Genuses ; and
          <lb/>from this Source have arisen almost all the Errors of the universal
          <lb/>Histories of this Nature, which have hitherto appear'd. But, to
          <lb/>return to the <hi>Bauhines</hi>: No more useful Work of the kind has
          <lb/>appear'd than the <hi>Pinax</hi>, nor was it possible to render it much
          <lb/>more perfect at the time in which it was written. Among the
          <lb/>fix hundred Plants describ'd by <hi>Caspar</hi> in the <hi>Prodromus Theatri
          <lb/>Botanici</hi>, many were receiv'd dry and Imperfect from his
          <lb/>Friends and Acquaintances. His Brother <hi>John</hi>, the' he us'd
          <lb/>the same Practice, yet gave his Descriptions far more natural
          <lb/>and accurate. But the great Fault of these two Authors seems
          <lb/>to consist in their having neglected to establish the Genuses of

          <lb/>than any who went before-him, by enriching it with numberless

          <lb/>Their Son <hi>Joseph</hi> was put to the Jesuits. College m <hi>Aix,</hi>
          <lb/>with a View to learn <hi>Latin</hi>, as the other Scholars' dis. But, as
          <lb/>soon aS he saw any Plants, the Bent of his Genius discover'd the
          <lb/>suture <hi>Botanist</hi>, for he was anxious and uneasy, till he sound out
          <lb/>their Names i He carefully remark'd their Differences, and
          <lb/>sometimes neglected to attend his. Class, in order to discover
          <lb/>Herbs, and study Nature in the Fields, instead of the Language
          <lb/>of the antient <hi>Romans</hi> in the Schoois. And as it is no uncommon
          <lb/>thing to see some People excel in an Art, by the mere
          <lb/>Force of Genius, without the Assistance of a Master, this young
          <lb/>Botanist had, by his own Industry, acquir'd a Knowledge of air
          <lb/>the Plants produced about the V illage where he was hern. ...
          <lb/>_ When he enter'd upon his Philosophical Studies,. he discover'd
          <lb/>no great Relish for what was taught him. In Disquisitions
          <lb/>of this Kind, instead of Nature, with whose Contemplation
          <lb/>he was so highly charm'd, he found only vague and abstracted
          <lb/>Ideas,-which decoy and amuse the Mind, without
          <lb/>enriching it with any thing that is solid and satissactory*
          <lb/>During this Period of his Education, he accidentally found the
          <lb/>Philosophy of <hi>Descartes</hi> in his Father's Study, and soon discover'd
          <lb/>it to be the very Thing he wanted. Tho' he could only
          <lb/>read the Preductions of this Author privately, and, as it were,
          <lb/>by Stealth, yet he read them with Care and Accuracy; and the
          <lb/>Father, who violentiy opposed so useful a Study, afforded bins,
          <lb/>without being sensible of it, the Advantages of a fine Education.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As he destin'd his young Son. for the Church, he made him
          <lb/>apply to the Study of Theology, and for that Purpose enter'd
          <lb/>him in a Seminary. But in his Breast <hi>Botany</hi> cousd not endure
          <lb/>a Rival, and the Bent of Nature was too powerful to he
          <lb/>balanced by any Views, or overcome by any Byas.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Notwithstanding the Intentions of the Father, the Son must
          <lb/>necessarily see Plants; and for this End he retired to prosecute
          <lb/>his darling Study, either to a curious Garden belonging to an
          <lb/>Apothecary <hi>osAix</hi>, or Io the neighbouring Fields, or to the
          <lb/>Summits of Rocks, winch had been inaccessible to others,
          <lb/>fir'd with a less ardent Desire of Knowledge than he. Either
          <lb/>by Stratagem or Presents he found Access to the most:
          <lb/>close and conceal'd Pisces, where he suspected there were Plants
          <lb/>not to be found elsewhere ; and when these Means sail'd, so
          <lb/>undaunted was his Resolution, that he would make his Way
          <lb/>into them in an unlawful and clandestine manner, rather than
          <lb/>.not satisfy his Curiosity; and, indeed, sor an Attempt of this
          <lb/>Kind, he once ran a Risque of being stoned to Death by the
          <lb/>Country-people, who took him for a Rohher. . But what Hardships
          <lb/>will not a Mind, actuated with an ardent and insatiable
          <lb/>Desire of Knowledge, undergo for Satisfaction?-</p>
        <p rend="indent">Mr. <hi>Tournefort</hi> was almost as fond os Anatomy and Chymistry
          <lb/>as he was of <hi>Botany</hi>; and at last Physic and Medicine so
          <lb/>engross'd his Affections, as to gain a thorough Victory over his
          <lb/>Inclinations to Theology, which he now resolved to drop. In
          <lb/>this Resolution he was encouraged by an Uncle on his Father's
          <lb/>Side, who was a Physician of great Skill and Reputation. ‘Soon
          <lb/>after, the Death os his Father in the Year 1677. left him at his
          <lb/>own Disposal, and Master of his own Inclinations.</p>
        <p rend="indent">He quickly improv'd this Revolution made in his Fortune

          <lb/>return'd with a large Quantity of beautiful dry Plants, which

          <lb/>only fuch Operations as may be perform'd without a great deal
          <lb/>of Exercise, Toil, and Fatigue. The Botanist must wander
          <lb/>thro' Mountains and Valleys, range the gloomy Forests, climb
          <lb/>the steepest Rocks, and expose his Life on the Brinks of hideous

          <lb/>traordinary Petrifications, and Crystallizations, and Shells os

          <lb/>which Vegetated, and had their, respective Seeds s. he was also
          <lb/>pretty much inclin'd to extend this System to Metals, and
          <lb/>seem'd inclin'd to transform every Object into the Nature os
          <lb/>Vegetables, the Coin templarion of winch afforded him so ecstatic
          <lb/>arid superlative a Delight. He also collected the Garments,

          <lb/>those happySouls who have the Art of doi
          <lb/>ing it. With all these Objects he had furnished a Museum,

        <p>When we take a View of the fine Qualities of which Ms,

          <lb/>of a real Philosopher may he look’d upon as sacred Archives
          <lb/>of inestimable Value. We may therefore account it an Adil
          <lb/>vantage to the Sciences, that in I7oo. Mr. <hi>Toumofort</hi> received
          <lb/>an Order from the King to travel <hi>into Greece, Asia,</hi>
          <lb/>and <hi>Africa</hi>, not only to take a View of the Plants mention'd
          <lb/>by the Antients, and perhaps to discover others unknown to
          <lb/>them, but also to make Observations upon Natural History
          <lb/>in general, upon antient and modern Geography, and even
          <lb/>upon the Customs, the Religion, and the Commerce, of the
          <lb/>People. He had Orders .to write, as often as he had Opportunities,
          <lb/>to Mr. <hi>de Pmtchartrain</hi>, and to give him a Detail of
          <lb/>his Discoveries and Adventures. Accordingly Mr. <hi>Tourriefort,</hi>
          <lb/>accompanied by Mr. <hi>Gundelsiocimcr</hi>, a <hi>German</hi>, and an excess
          <lb/>lent Physician, and Mr. <hi>Aubries</hi>, a skilful Painter, went as <hi>far</hi>

          <lb/>by Land. But Mr- <hi>Toumofort</hi> with his Associates were as littie
          <lb/>at Sea as was possible, disdained the common Roads, and
          <lb/>bravely struck out new ones hefore untrod by Mortals. A

          <lb/>upon reading an Account of their Descent into the Grotto of
          <lb/><hi>Antiparos</hi>, which consists of three or four hideous Abysses, one
          <lb/>after another. Mr. <hi>Tournefort</hi> had here the sensible Pleasure
          <lb/>of beholding a new Species of Garden, in which the Plants</p>
        <p>were different Shoots of Marble, as yet young and springing,

          <lb/>under some one .or other of the six hundred and seventy
          <lb/>three Genufes he had already established; and, for all the rest,
          <lb/>he had only twenty-five Genuses to create, without heing</p>

          <lb/>justly esteem'd an useful and important Branch of I.ear<hi rend="u">ni</hi>n<hi rend="u">g</hi>People
          <lb/>are generally convinc'd, that Simples make up <hi rend="u">almost</hi>

          <lb/>Plants to he proper Remedies for their Disorders, so she seems

          <lb/>with an uncommon Confidence in the Remedies prepar'd from

          <lb/>so useful an Instinct, yet she has left uS to nfe the laborious
          <lb/>Methods of Reason, Deduction, and Experiment, in order to
          <lb/>discover the Virtues and Uses of each particular Plant; a
          <lb/>Talk, in the Execution of which, the Reason of Man can
          <lb/>with Difficulty come up to the Instinct of some <hi rend="u">Animals</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Works of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> and <hi>Dioscorides</hi>, of <hi>Pliny</hi> and
          <lb/><hi>Galen</hi>, are sufficient Proofs, that the Antients <hi rend="u">had</hi> some Knowledge
          <lb/>of Plants, tho' their Learning in this Particular was Very
          <lb/>superficial, defective, and imperfect, since <hi>Dioscorides</hi>, who
          <lb/>applied himself to this Study in a particular manner, and acquir'd
          <lb/>the greatest Reputation, on account of the Progress he
          <lb/>made in it, has only mention’d about six hundred Plants, and ..
          <lb/>described them in a manner so obscure and intricate, that 'tis
          <lb/>often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to know them by his
          <lb/>Desciptionos them.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Ages immediately succeeding that of <hi>Dios.eatides</hi>, did
          <lb/>not greatly enrich Botany ; for in them all the Sciences seem
          <lb/>to have heen Veil'd with Clouds of Darkness and Ignorance,
          <lb/>- which were not dispelled till the fifteenth Century. Then in-.
          <lb/>deed People began to read the Antients with great Diligence,
          <lb/>in order to make themselves Masters of their Knowledge,
          <lb/>which had heen so long involv’d in Obscurity and Oblivion.
          <lb/>The Botanists sought for Plants no-where else than in the Books
          <lb/>Ofthe <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>-, and even <hi>Mattheolus</hi>, the most celebrated
          <lb/>Commentator upon <hi>Dioscorides</hi>, was not at the Pains
          <lb/>to compare the Plants produced by Nature, with the Descriptions
          <lb/>his Author had given of them; thut, attaching himself sacredly
          <lb/>and inviolably to the Descriptions, form'd to himself
          <lb/>ideal Plants, which he thought Nature must, or at least ought
          <lb/>to have produc'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But, when the Sciences hegan again to be cultivated. Reason
          <lb/>assumed her just Prerogative, People studied Nature as well as
          <lb/>Books, and Ventur'd to seek for Herbs in the open Fields.
          <lb/>Upon this. Botany was enriched with new Discoveries, and became
          <lb/>daily more extensive.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Notwithstanding this favourable Revolution, a Difficulty still
          <lb/>remained to he surmounted. The immense Number of Plants,
          <lb/>all differing from each other, began to prove a Grievance to
          <lb/>Botanists ; for whet Memory was sufficient to retain so inconceivable
          <lb/>a Variety of different Names, as were already in Use,
          <lb/>or eVen all the new ones, which were daily becoming necessary? </p>
        <pb n="32"/>
        <p rend="indent">The Botanists therefore bethought themselves of inventing a.
          <lb/>Method proper for the Removal of this Grievance ; but it must
          <lb/>be own'd, that few of them apply'd themselves to this Discovery
          <lb/>; that those who did, were -pretty late in doing is ; and
          <lb/>that others disputed either - the Possibility or Usefalness of fuch

          <lb/>common to their respective Genus, that too great a Number
          <lb/>of particular and widely different Names might he avoided;
          <lb/>Custom has established this Practice with regard to all the SpecieS
          <lb/>of the Ranunculus ; but 'tis a hard Task to extend this
          <lb/>Plan to. a great many other Plants, whose Species do not easily
          <lb/>exhibit to View what they have in common, and such Circumstances
          <lb/>aS may serve to establish their proper Genus.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In order io preserve that Uniformity which Method requireS ;
          <lb/>in the System of Plants, the same Idea must prevail in the Establishment
          <lb/>of the different Genuses ; and they must all be deduloni
          <lb/>from the same Principles. " A Plant, according to
          <lb/>" nvlr. <hi>Tournefort</hi>, is an organiz'd Body, which has always a</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Root, always probably a Fruit or Seed, and almost always a
          <lb/>" Stalk, Leaves, and Flowers.'* These are the five Parts; i
          <lb/>some of which are essential to all Plants in general, whereas
          <lb/>others belong only to some particular Species of Plants. It is<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
          <lb/>evident, that the Resemblance between some of these Parts
          <lb/>will constitute the Genuses; but this Resemblance ought always ’
          <lb/>tothe between the corresponding Parts ; and our whole Business ’
          <lb/>is to find out to which we ought to give the Preference. Mrs _
          <lb/><hi>Tournefort</hi> determines for: the Flowers and the Fruit taken in
          <lb/>Conjunctiori. - .</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>sudesuer</hi> and <hi>Colonna</hi>, two of the most learned Botanists that
          <lb/>have hitherto appeared, were of the same Opinion ; and indeed
          <lb/>the Intention of Nature seems to point out these two Parts as
          <lb/>the principal and most important ; since the Whole of the
          <lb/>Plant, and all the Apparatus of its Organs, which is greater and
          <lb/>more _ magnificent than- jo commonly believed,' seems only
          <lb/>form'd with a View to the Production os the Seed, or, which
          <lb/>is the same, of the Fruit, -which is the Covering and Nourishment
          <lb/>of the Seed. As for the Flower, it is only designed for a
          <lb/>short time, to afford the growing FnIit a Nourishment more
          <lb/>delicate, better prepared, and more Agreeable to its Nature,
          <lb/>than what it could draw from the Leaves.</p>

        <p rend="indent"><orth>AU</orth> Plants whose Flowers and Fruits are of the fame Figure
          <lb/>and Disposition, are, then, of the same Genus, according to Mrs
          <lb/><hi>Tournefortis</hi> System ; and the Roots, the Stalks, and Leaves,
          <lb/>are not on this Occasion taken into Consideration. _ But when
          <lb/>any particular Genus is afterwards to he divided into the several
          <lb/>Species comprehended under it, we must consider the Roots,
          <lb/>the.Stalks,“and Leaves, and those Plants which either differ in
          <lb/>all these'three Parts, or only in some of them, are taken to
          <lb/>belong to different Species. :</p>
      </entryFree>
      <entryFree>
        <p rend="indent"><orth>AS</orth> in all this the express Design is not exactly to follow or
          <lb/>imitate Nature, (who, in the Production of Vegetables, seems
          <lb/>not to have been Very solicitous about a System) but Only to
          <lb/>establish an arbitrary Plan for facilitating the Knowledge of
          <lb/>Plants, the Goofiness of any Method invented for this Purpose
          <lb/>cannot be so properly proV'd by philosophical Reasonings, as by
          <lb/>the Advantages it brings along with it ; its Clearness and Perspicuity,
          <lb/>find the Delight and Satisfaction that may possibly be
          <lb/>found in it; and upon these Principles we must judge of the
          <lb/>Sufficiency and Perfection of Mr. <hi>T.oumeforsts</hi> System.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It mute, indeed, he owned, his Plan is not universal, fince
          <lb/>there are Plants which have neither Flowers, Fruit, nor Seed ;
          <lb/>at least the Fruit and Seeds are either not at all Visible, without
          <lb/>the Assistance of a Microscope, or not easily discovered even
          <lb/>withit; so that we are obliged, without perceiving them,. to
          <lb/>reason analogically for thein real Existence.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Now in an Affair of this Nature, 'tis necessary there should
          <lb/>he evident and uncontroverted Characteristics subjected to the
          <lb/>Eye. And the Assistance of the Microscope is not in this Cafe
          <lb/>admitted, and much less the most plausible and solid Hypothesis.
          <lb/>Mr. <hi>Tournefort</hi> is therefore reduced to a Necessity of distributing
          <lb/>these Rants into separate Genuses, which he regulates and fixes
          <lb/>by their most remarkable Parts. And as these Genuses are only
          <lb/>very few in Number, they make, if I may so speak, but a very
          <lb/>inconsiderable Chasm in the Universality of Mr. <hi>Tourneforfs</hi>
          <lb/>Plan, which, however, is more extensive and general than any
          <lb/>other that could have been thought os.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Sometimes also, when the Flowers and Fruits taken in Conjunction
          <lb/>are not sufficient for fixing the Genus, he calis in to
          <lb/>his Assistance not only the Roots, or the S<hi rend="u">talks</hi>, or the -Leaves,
          <lb/>but also, if there is a Necessity for it, some of their most obvious
          <lb/>and sensible Properties, such as its manner of growing, or
          <lb/>what Botanists call the Ρργί <hi><hi rend="sup">O</hi>f <hi rend="sup">α</hi> Plant</hi> ; that is, its general</p>
        <p>Conformation, Or what <hi rend="u">strikes</hi> the Eye immediately upon its
          <lb/>heing presented ; for fince, in this Case, there is not a natural
          <lb/>System whose Rules would he unexceptionable, we must rest
          <lb/>contented with an artificial one, as perfect and complete as Diligence
          <lb/>and industry can possibly make it. -</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Distribution of Plants under their Genuses renders it '
          <lb/>more easy to name them; for they have first thein generical
          <lb/>and common Name, to which we add another, which determines
          <lb/>their Species ; so that the very Name of each Plant be- .
          <lb/>comes a Definition of it.. .It isutrue, as the Botanists, who have,
          <lb/>gone before Mr. <hi>Toutmofors</hi>, have not had the Genuses of Plants
          <lb/>at all in their View, or, at least, have not had an Eye to the
          <lb/>fame Genuses he has establish’d, he is, for this very Reason, often
          <lb/>obliged to change the Names which they had affixed to
          <lb/>particular Plante ; but he carefully mentions the antient Names
          <lb/>given them by different Botanists, provided their Characters
          <lb/>were famous enough to deserve his Regard or Attention. And
          <lb/>if Students in Botany would but habituate and familiarize themselves
          <lb/>to the new Names used by Mr. <hi>Tournefort</hi>, they would
          <lb/>reap the Advantage by it, of knowing more readfly the Genuses
          <lb/>and Species of Plants in a System, which seems excellently calculated
          <lb/>for the. Advancement and Improvement of Botany.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Some Plants lately discover’d, have, as it were, of their own
          <lb/>accord, rang'd themselves under certain Genuses,-already established
          <lb/>by Mr. <hi>Tournefort</hi> ; and when others shall be discover’d,
          <lb/>which, in Consequence of their Flowers and Fruits, shall call
          <lb/>for new Genuses, we have no more to do than to establish
          <lb/>them. . . . . - -</p>
        <p rend="indent">s Mr. <hi>Tournefort</hi>, in his Institutions, has reduced the Whole
          <lb/>to aheut six hundred and seventy-three Genuses, which comprehend-more
          <lb/>than eight thousand eight hundred and forty-fix Spe'
          <lb/>cies, including all Land and Sea Plants hitherto known; so
          <lb/>. that at present we know more Genuses of Plants, than <hi>Dioscit</hi>..</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>rides</hi> did different Plants.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But as the Memory would be very much burden'd with six
          <lb/>hundred and seventy-three Genuses, whose different Characteristics
          <lb/>must necessarily be known ; and as the Number os those
          <lb/>Genuses must undoubtedly be increased in Process of Time ;
          <lb/>Mr. <hi>Tournefort</hi> sound out a happy Expedient for rendering thin
          <lb/>Talk considerably more easy, by reducing the several Genuses
          <lb/>to Classes ; and the is the first of all the Botanists who formed
          <lb/><hi>so</hi> noble and useful a Design. In order to establish his Classes,
          <lb/>he only considered the Flowers of Plants, if they had any, as
          <lb/>indeed most of them have. He determines all the known Figures
          <lb/>of the Flowers of Plants; and . finds them to be only four-.
          <lb/>teen in Number, which of Consequence must only produce
          <lb/>fourteen Classes, if their Number was not augmented by those
          <lb/>Plants which have no Flower, and by the Distinction which it
          <lb/>was necessary to make hetween Herbs or Suffrutices <hi>{Underscbrubso</hi>
          <lb/>and Shrubs or Trees, the Difference of whose Bulks has
          <lb/>render'd it improper to range them under the same Class, tho'
          <lb/>the Flower in heth should he alike. But notwithstanding these
          <lb/>Augmentations, the Whole of Mr. <hi>Tourneforgis</hi> Plan in his *
          <lb/><hi>Botanical Institutions</hi> is comprehended under no more than '
          <lb/>twenty-two Classes.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is then sufficient to retain in the Memory fourteen Figures
          <lb/>of Flowers ; and when we see the Flower of a Plant which we
          <lb/>do not know, we may find in the Institutions to what Class it'
          <lb/>properly belongs. - Some Days after the Flower, the Fruit will
          <lb/>appear, which gives the Genus; and all the other Parts of the
          <lb/>Plant will determine the Species. If the unknown Plant is not
          <lb/>in Flower, we must wait till it appears, before we can pronounce
          <lb/>certainly and infallibly.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Mr. <hi>Tournefort</hi> has regulated his Classes by the Flowers,
          <lb/>rather than by the Fruits of Plants; because when we see the
          <lb/>Flower appear, we have but a short Time to wait hesore we
          <lb/>see the Fruit, and thus determine the Genus; whereas, when
          <lb/>we see Only the Fruit, we must wait till the ensuing Year, hefore
          <lb/>we can have an Opportunity of Viewing the Flower.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Upon this Plan all the Difficulties of Botany are render'd as
          <lb/>easy to be surmounted, as the Nature of the Thing can possibly
          <lb/>admit of; and that prodigious Number of Plants, which not
          <lb/>only adorn the Surface of our Glohe, bur also those which Vegerate
          <lb/>in the Bottom of the Ocean, are reduc'd to so narrow
          <lb/>Bounds, as to be easily retained by the Memory, without in
          <lb/>the least distracting the Imagination. But all this is no more
          <lb/>than the first Institutions, and, as it were, the Out-lines of
          <lb/>Botany ; for the Knowledge of the Virtues of Plants, which is
          <lb/>the most important Part of the Science, is a Field of a vast and
          <lb/>unlimited Extent; but 'tis still more spacious and extensive,
          <lb/>if" to their real inherent Virtues we join these ascribed to
          <lb/>them by .the Whim, the Ignorance, or Caprice, os different

          <lb/>have been an Honour to their Country, and a Blessing to Mankind,
          <lb/>are, however, not mention’d in the foregoing Account.
          <lb/>Among these, the first who occurs is <hi>Carolus Plumicr</hi>. He was
          <lb/>born at <hi>Marseilles</hi> in 1646. and was contemporary with <hi>Tournesori</hi>..'
          <lb/>Thod he was descended of an obscure Family, yet he
          <lb/>soon became conspicuous, not only on account os ins MechaIdeal
          <lb/>and Botanical Observations, but also on account os the annexed
          <lb/>Figures, delineated and engraved by his own Hand. Besides
          <lb/>his happy Turn for Mathematics and Mechanics, he was
          <lb/>an industrious and skilful Botanist. He presented his first La-:
          <lb/>hours of this kind to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, who, as a Reward
          <lb/>for his growing Merit, gave him at once the Title and the Salary
          <lb/>of King's Botanist. Besides his Descriptions of <hi>American</hi>
          <lb/>Plants, his History of Ferns,, and his establishing some new
          <lb/>Genuses, there are several otherWorks, wrotewith his ownHand,
          <lb/>which are preserved in the Libraries of the Royal Academy, and,
          <lb/>that belonging to the Monastery of the .Justus in <hi>Parti</hi>. These
          <lb/>Works contain not only the Figures and Descriptions of about
          <lb/>nine hundred <hi>American</hi> Plants, but also the History of a great
          <lb/>Variety of Birds, Fishes, Shells, and Insects, which he had.
          <lb/>sech, and whose Figures he had drawn in <hi>America</hi>. Whilst he
          <lb/>intended a Voyage to <hi>Peru</hi>, in order to discover something more
          <lb/>concerning the famous <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, he was seized with a
          <lb/>Pleurisy, of which he died in the sixtieth Year os his Age,
          <lb/>in 1704.  x</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Merit of <hi>Samuel Doody</hi> may be Judg’d of by the Specimens
          <lb/>of his Botanical Observations, given in <hi>Basis</hi> History of
          <lb/>Plants. He was born in the County os <hi>Stafford</hi>, and, by his
          <lb/>Diligence, Industry, and Sagacity, soon distinguish'd himself
          <lb/>among the Apothecaries of <hi>London</hi> ; by whom, on account os
          <lb/>his Skill in Natural History and Botany, he was made Master
          <lb/>and Protector of their Garden at <hi>Chelsea. Ray</hi> ingenuouby
          <lb/>confesses, that he borrow'd a great many things from him. He
          <lb/>was a diligent Inquirer into the Natures of Mosses, capillary
          <lb/>Herbs, Fucuses, and Corals ; so that Botany and Natural
          <lb/>History sustain'd a very considerable Loss by his Death in 1706.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Of those celebrated Botanists who have died fince the Days
          <lb/>os <hi>T.ougrnefort, Petrus Hotto</hi> is the first. He was born at <hi>Amsterdam</hi>

          <lb/>Physic in the University of <hi>Leyden</hi>, he declin'd Practice,
          <lb/>that he might pursue the Study of Botany to the greater Advantage.
          <lb/>With this View he travell'd into <hi>Denmark</hi>, in order to
          <lb/>make Observations on the Plants os that Kingdom. But he was

          <lb/>Lectures for <hi>Herman</hi>, who was appointed to go to the <hi>Indies
          <lb/>to make</hi> Observations on exotic Plants; and he had the Promise
          <lb/>of this Professor's Place, if he should happen to die in his
          <lb/>Voyage. Dining <hi>Herman’s</hi> Absence he taught with great Applause.
          <lb/><hi>Harman</hi>, upon .his Return, resum'd his Place ; but,
          <lb/>after his Death, <hi>Hotto</hi> succeeded him in 1695.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Besides his elegant Oration <hi>de Historia et Fatis Botanices,</hi>
          <lb/>deliver'd that same Year, he endeavour’d a Reconciliation of

          <lb/>I 7 O9. put a fatal Stop to the Execution of so useful a Design.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Among all the Botanists produc'd by the present Age, none
          <lb/>is more justly celebrated, than Dr. <hi>Sherard</hi>, who had his Education
          <lb/>begun at <hi>Merchant-taylors School</hi>, and afterwards became
          <lb/>a Fellow of <hi>St. Juhrfs College, Oxford</hi>. His Learning, together
          <lb/>with his other Qualifications, procur'd him an Opportunity
          <lb/>of travelling with two Noblemen at different times; during
          <lb/>which he visited many Countries of <hi>Europe</hi>, in which he was a
          <lb/>diligent Observer of the Plants produc’d by each. Upon inis
          <lb/>Return to his native Country, he was created Consul of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
          <lb/>which gave him an Opportunity of viewing the <hi>Asiatic</hi> Plants,
          <lb/>At his Death he left three thousand Pounds to the Physic-garden
          <lb/>at <hi>Oxford</hi>. He was much admir'd by <hi>Boerhaave</hi>, who also
          <lb/>makes honourable Mention of his Brother <hi>fames Sherard</hi>, as an
          <lb/>accurate and curious Botanist.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Mr. <hi>Isaac Rand</hi>, Dr. <hi>Martyn</hi>, Dr. <hi>Dillenius</hi>, and Mr.
          <lb/><hi>Miller</hi>, are so famin for their Knowledge of Botanical Subjects,
          <lb/>that, to name them, is to praise them.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It would be doing a Piece of Injustice, not to make honourable
          <lb/>Mention of the following Gentlemen, Messieurs <hi>Buddle,
          <lb/>Lawfon, Lhwyd, Newton, Stonestreet, Dubois, Dale, Man-,
          <lb/>ningham</hi>, and <hi>Richardson</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I must add, that Sir <hi>Hans Sloane</hi>, by his Skill, Industry,
          <lb/>and Munificence, has greatly contributed to the Perfection of

        <p rend="indent">The last Author I, shall mention, who has lent his friendly
          <lb/>Aid to the Improvement of <hi>Botany</hi>, is the justly celebrated
          <lb/><hi>Bocrhaave</hi> ; and, indeed, by his Performances of this kind, he
          <lb/>has, at once, oblig'd the World, and prov'd the Force and Ex.

          <lb/>Productions pronounce him an accurate, a diligent, and
          <lb/>penetrating Botanist. The', by the surprising Degrees of Perfection,
          <lb/>at which this Author arriv'd in other Branches ofLearning,
          <lb/>one would be tempted to suspect, that he had too small a
          <lb/>Portion os Time lest for. making any considerable Advancements
          <lb/>in the Knowledge of Plants ; yet, when his judicious Divisions
          <lb/>and Distributions of them home to be perus'd, we are inclin’d to
          <lb/>think he had employ'd the Whole of his: Life in the Study of
          <lb/>Botany.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In 17IO. the Year after he was made Professor of Botany,
          <lb/>he publish’d, in one <hi>Octavo</hi> Volume, an Index of the Plants
          <lb/>with winch the Physic-garden at <hi>Leyden</hi> was then stor'd. This
          <lb/>Work, tho' perhaps the most perfect of its kind the World had
          <lb/>ever seen, began by degrees to be look'd upon aS very imperfect
          <lb/>in its Author’s Eyes ; tor his Impartiality, join'd with the fuperior
          <lb/>Strength of hts Judgment, enabled bun to discover Blemishes
          <lb/>in his own Productions, which escap'd tire Eyes of all, except
          <lb/>the happy Few, who are bless'd with a discerning Judgment. He
          <lb/>had us'd <hi>new</hi> Names to <hi>old</hi> Plants; and, as he became sensible,
          <lb/>that no Circumstance had a more evident Tendency to create
          <lb/>Confusion and Disorder in Botany, he was resolv'd to rectify
          <lb/>this Mistake, which was, perhaps, adverted to by few except
          <lb/>himself. Accordingly, in I72O. he presented the World with
          <lb/>a second Index, in two <hi>squarto</hi> Volumes, to which he has prefix'd
          <lb/>a new and large Preface, with a Plan, and short History, of
          <lb/>the Physic-garden. In the Preface to this Work, he affords us
          <lb/>an Instance of that disinterested Candour, and noble Humility
          <lb/>of Soul, which is, at once, the peculiar Glory, <hi>of</hi> human
          <lb/>Nature, and the distinguishing Badge of every Mind that is
          <lb/>truly <hi>great</hi>. .It is customary sor Men to be blind to the Imperfections
          <lb/>os their inental, <hi>as</hi> well as of their natural Offspring r
          <lb/>Indulgent Fathers, and tender Mothers, are not fonder of their
          <lb/>vicious, deform'd, and ill-dispos'd Children, than some Authors
          <lb/>. are of their own Productions, however lame, monstrous, inco.
          <lb/>herent, and absurd. How sar the incomparable <hi>Boerhaave</hi> was
          <lb/>remov'd from this Weakness, so destructive of the true interests
          <lb/>of Truth, the Reader may judge from the following
          <lb/>Tranflation ofhis own Words in the above-mention'd Preface.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In this Edition I heve endeavour’d to avoid the Innovation
          <lb/>" of Names, aS much as the Nature of the Thing would possi"
          <lb/>bly allow, in my former Index I transgressed against this
          <lb/>" fundamental Law, by imposing new Names upon Plants,
          <lb/>" which were long ago much better known by other Deno"
          <lb/>Initiations. I ingenuoufly confess my Error, and am heartily
          <lb/>" sorry for Iny Fault. The Hurry in which the Work was
          <lb/>" compil'd, and my Mind not heing employ'd on Botanical Sub"
          <lb/>Jocts for a great while hefore, laid : a satai Foundation sor my
          <lb/>" Error, which I now endeavour to amend ; and the. few
          <lb/>" Transgressions of this kind, which are found in the present
          <lb/>An Performance, will, I hope, be pardon’d by such as have any
          <lb/>" tolerable Share of Goodness, or a sympathizing Sense of the
          <lb/>" Frailties to which Mankind is unavoidably subjected. But I
          <lb/>" am of Opinion, that nothing more fatal can hesal Botany,
          <lb/>." than that every Author should, without any Necessity, and
          <lb/>" with no other View than the Gratification of his own Ca"
          <lb/>price, impose new Names on Plants which were before accu"
          <lb/>rarely describ'd, and properly denominated."</p>
        <p rend="indent">Nothing paints .a truly great.Man in Colours that strike the
          <lb/>Dyes, of the discerning Mind with more Energy, and captivating
          <lb/>Force, than a Confessioriofhis Weakness from his own Mouth.
          <lb/>He did hot use the low and difingenuous Arts of Detraction and
          <lb/>Obloquy, in order to establish his own Fame as a Botanist ; for
          <lb/>his History of his Predecessors is one continu'd Strain of Praife
          <lb/>and Approbation. Men who want Merit themselves, are only
          <lb/>fond of stripping others Of theirs, and raifinga short-lined Character
          <lb/>upon the Ruins os real and uncontested Worth.</p>
        <p rend="indent">His Industry, and conscientious Discharge of the Office with
          <lb/>which he was entrusted, appears from this Circumstance, that,
          <lb/>in the Space of ten Years, the Time between the Publication of
          <lb/>his first and second Indexes, he had enrich'd the Physic-garden
          <lb/>with double the Number of Plants it formerly contain'd. But
          <lb/>this was- not all; he discover'd a fine Taste by the happy Choice
          <lb/>he made, of them, and the beautiful and regular Order into
          <lb/>.which he dispos'd them: And, as they were rang'd with a refin'd
          <lb/>Tastesiso they, were cultivated with the nicest Judgment; for
          <lb/>it must not be forgot, that all this Variety of delicate and tender
          <lb/>Plants, under <hi>Eoerhaavfs</hi> Management, acquir'd a sar. greater
          <lb/>Strength and Vigour, than the same Plants generally do under
          <lb/>the Care and Conduct of other Botanists.</p>
        <p rend="indent">in the Conduct of his Botanical Works, he has discover'd a
          <lb/>Mind oped to Truth, and entirely free from that base and servile
          <lb/>Attachment to <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi>, which has, in all
          <lb/>Ages, prov’d the Bane of Learning and good Sense. He had a
          <lb/>Judgment of his own, and bravely dat'd to use it. He follow'd
          <lb/>Truth where-ever she led him, and did not, like some of his
          <lb/>Predecessors, blindly follow .the Methods of <hi>Rast</hi> and <hi>Morison,</hi>
          <lb/>but selected, from a Variety of Authors, fuch Materials as were
          <lb/>proper for forming a hetter and less exceptionable System 5 and</p>
        <p>where he found these defective, he added what he thought proper
          <lb/>ofhis own. <hi>Lirnaus, R</hi> competent Judge of these Matters,
          <lb/>affirms that he has form’d his <hi>Genera Plantarum</hi> in the most
          <lb/>judicious manner ; fince he was the first of all the Botanists who
          <lb/>call'd in to his Assistance all the Pans of Plants which concur
          <lb/>to Fructification, and gave so accurate and minute a Description
          <lb/>of them, as to render the Arts of Sculpture and Colouring almost
          <lb/>entirely useless. <hi>John Baubine, Morison, Tournefort</hi>, and
          <lb/>some others, tho' justly celebrated for enlarging the Catalogue
          <lb/>of Plants, and classing them more judicioufly than their Predecessors
          <lb/>had done, yet added a fresh Load to Botany, hefore too
          <lb/>burdensome to the Memory, bjv fixing new-coin’d Names to
          <lb/>such Plants aS were accurately enough described under old ones
          <lb/>full as proper. This Misfortune made <hi>Boerhaave</hi> wait impatiently
          <lb/>for the Publication of the <hi>Pinax</hi>, expected from Consul <hi>Sherard</hi>,
          <lb/>who, in that Work, design'd to fix the various Names
          <lb/>given to each Plant, in a manner so correct and accurate, thet
          <lb/>there should not remain the least Motive or Temptation, for the
          <lb/>future, to forge any new Appellations. By this means he proposed
          <lb/>to fix a Standard in this Part of Botany, and render it
          <lb/>immutable and invariable for ever after. But I don't find this
          <lb/>has ever heen publish’d.</p>
        <p>Tho' it is certain the individual Species of Plants never vary
          <lb/>essentially from themselves, yet it is equally obvious, that, by
          <lb/>Difference of Soil, Situation, and Culture, they may assume
          <lb/>such a Variety of external Appearances as to deceive anyone,
          <lb/>who does not, with <hi>Boerhaave</hi>, distinguish them by the Parts of
          <lb/>Fructification, which never alter. This seems to be the peculiar
          <lb/>Excellency of <hi>Boerhaavels</hi> Method, above all others the
          <lb/>World has hitherto seem Since Botanists, aster comparing
          <lb/>Plants thus settled with the Descriptions os Authors, have collected
          <lb/>all the Various Names given by different Authors to each
          <lb/>Plant ; and fince <hi>Vaillant</hi>, and some others, have furnish’d us
          <lb/>with exact Descriptions and Delineations os them, according to
          <lb/>what they really are, in the several Places where they are naturally
          <lb/>produced; and by preserving them complete and entire, by
          <lb/>means of proper Leaves of Paper, form'd to perfect an <hi>Hirtus
          <lb/>Siccus</hi>, they have been able to fix the precise Number os Plants
          <lb/>hitherto known, and to secure the distinct and discriminate
          <lb/>Knowledge of them to the latest Posterity: This, amongst
          <lb/>others, is one Advantage, winch we originally owe to the Perfection
          <lb/>and Extent <hi>of</hi> Mr. <hi>Boerhaawsts</hi> System. The Publication
          <lb/>Of his Index, abstracting from its own Perfection, produced
          <lb/>a Very happy Effect, both with regard to himself, and other
          <lb/>Botanists, who before were unwilling to communicate Their
          <lb/><hi>Duplicates</hi>, without an Assurance, that they should, in return, .
          <lb/>have their Deficiencies supplied : But when his Index appear'd,
          <lb/>they perceived he was possess'd of whet they wanted ; a Circumstance,
          <lb/>from which he was certain of obtaining his Requests
          <lb/>from them on the Foot of Exchange. Thus the same Plane
          <lb/>came under the Inspection and Management of different Botanists,
          <lb/>by which means each had an Opportunity of making his
          <lb/>own Observations on it ; a Circumstance which Tends more to
          <lb/>the Advancement ofBotany, than perhaps every one is aware of.
          <lb/>To his Skill in Botany he added the. most extensive and distinguish'd
          <lb/>Gratitude ;.-sor in an Oration deliver'd in I73I. on resigning
          <lb/>his Professorship, he immortalizes the Names of his Correspondents
          <lb/>; and, in the warmest Strains os Gratitude, .recites
          <lb/>the Friendships and Favours of the <hi>Sherards</hi>, Sir <hi>Hans Sloane,</hi>
          <lb/>Baron <hi>Bajsund</hi>, and about forty more of different Nations.</p>
        <p>Besides, his Botanical Knowledge was not of the barren
          <lb/>Kind ; for it furnish'd him with new Subjects for Chymical
          <lb/>Operations, and new Medicines for Use. About seventeen
          <lb/>Years after the Publication of his Index, he, in this Lectures,
          <lb/>gave a full Description of the Plants, together with an Account
          <lb/>of their Virtues ; but he never published these, which ismuch
          <lb/>to he lamented.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I shall now proceed to specify some of the modern Discoveries,
          <lb/>relative to the Structure and Vegetation of Plants.</p>
        <p><hi>The</hi> STRUCTURE <hi>of</hi> VEGETABLES.</p>
        <p>in treating this curious Subject, we shall pursue that Method,
          <lb/>which, as Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> justly observes, is follow'd by Nature herself,
          <lb/>in her continued Series of Vegetations, proceeding from
          <lb/>the Seed sown to the Formation of the .Root,. Trunk, Branch,
          <lb/>Leaf, Flower, Fruit, and, last of all, to the Seed to he sown
          <lb/>again'; to every one of which we shall speak in their particular
          <lb/>Order. . ..... -
          <lb/>_ The Seed of a Plans, then, is that Part by which the Plant is
          <lb/>propagated, and consistaofan Embryo, with its Coat or Cover,
          <lb/>winch Embryo contains the whole Plant in Miniature, .and is
          <lb/>therefore call'd the Gem or Bud, and is rooted in the Placenta
          <lb/>or Cotyledon ; winch last serves the fame Purposes in Vegetables, '
          <lb/>as the Secundines, or the Chorion and Amnion, in Animals.</p>
        <p>y But tho' the Constitution of the Seed is essentially the same
          <lb/>in all Vegetables, yet, as some are more convenient for ObserVation
          <lb/>than others, we shall chuse to instance the great Gardenbean;
          <lb/>which, if we dissect, we shall find cloath’cl with a double
          <lb/>Vest or Coat. These, while the Bean is green, are separable,
          <lb/>and easily distinguish'd ; bus, when it is dry, cleave so close </p>
        <pb n="37"/>
        <p rend="indent">together, that the Eye, not hesore <hi rend="u">instr</hi>ucted, will judge them
          <lb/>but one ; the inner Coat (which is of the most rare Contexture)
          <lb/>so far shrinking up as to seem only the Roughness of the
          <lb/>outer.'<space type="tab"> </space><hi rend="sup">W</hi> . -</p>
        <p rend="indent">At the thick End of the Bean, in the outer Coat, there is a
          <lb/>very’ small Foramen or Hole, which, in Dissection, is found to
          <lb/>terminate against the Point of that Part call'd the Radicle, of
          <lb/>which we shall speak hereafter; and is of that Capacity aS to
          <lb/>admit a small Wyre, and is most conspicuous in a green Bean.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Foramen may be observed, not only in the great Garden-bean,
          <lb/>but also in the other Kinds ; in the <hi>French</hi> Bean Very
          <lb/>plainly, in Pease, Lupines, Vetches, Lentiles, and other Pulse;
          <lb/>and in many Seeds not reckon'd of this Kindred, as in that of
          <lb/>Fenugreek, Goats-rue, and others ; -in many of which it is so
          <lb/>very small, as scarcely, without the Help os Glasses, to he discover'd
          <lb/>; and in fome not without cutting off Part of the Seed,
          <lb/>which otherwise would intercept the Sight.</p>
        <p rend="indent">All‘Seeds which have thick or hard Coats, have the same
          <lb/>likewise perforated in this or some other manner; and accordingly,
          <lb/>althoI the Coats of such Seeds as are lodged in Shells or
          <lb/>Stones, being thin, are not Visibly, perforated; yet the Stones
          <lb/>and Shelis themselves always are.</p>
        <p rend="indent">And for the sake of this Aperture it is, that Acorns, Nuts,
          <lb/>Beans, Cucumbers, and most other Seeds, are, in their Formation,
          <lb/><hi>so placed</hi>, that the Radicle still stands next it, that, upon
          <lb/>Vegetation, it may have a free and ready Passage into the
          <lb/>.'Mould. _ . st. .</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>That</hi> this Foramen exists, even in old setting Beans, likewise
          <lb/>appears, upon their being soak'd for some time in Water ;
          <lb/>for then taking them out, and crushing them a little, many
          <lb/>small Bubbles will alternately arise, and break upon them. And, *
          <lb/>indeed, a free Access of the Ain is as absolutely necessary to
          <lb/>maintain the Principle of Vegetation in the dry Seed, (tho’ in a
          <lb/>less Degree) as to nourish the Plant when germinated; which
          <lb/>is well known to the Seedsmen, who find by Experience, that
          <lb/>all sorts of Seeds are best preserved, if kept in the Pods or Huiks
          <lb/>wherein they grew, and not shut up too close from the Air.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The outer Coats of the Bean, then, being stripp'd off, the
          <lb/>proper Seed shews itself, which, as we hesore observed, consists
          <lb/>os a main Body, Cover, or Cotyledon, and an Embryo, or
          <lb/>young Plant; which last may also he distinguish'd into two.
          <lb/>Parts, the Radicle, and the Plume. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Now the main Body is not one entire Piece, but is always
          <lb/>divided lengthwise into two Halves or Lobes, which are both
          <lb/>Join’d together at the Basis of the Bean. These Lobes, in dry
          <lb/>Beans, are but difficultiy separated or observed ; but in young
          <lb/>ones, especially heil’d, they easily flip asunder.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There are some few Seeds, indeed, which are not divided
          <lb/>into two Lobes, but more; aS that of Cresses, which have six;
          <lb/>and some are not at all divided, but entire, aS Corn: Excepting
          <lb/>.which few, all other Seeds, even the smallest, are divided, like
          <lb/>. the Bean, into just two Lobes. But in all Seeds whatsoever,
          <lb/>they perform the same Office to the infant Plant, as the Membranes,
          <lb/>(call’d <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnion</hi> by Anatomists) <hi>Placenta</hi> or
          <lb/><hi>Cotyledons</hi>, cafl'd-the After-birth, do to the Embryos of Animals.
          <lb/>When the Plant begins to take Root, and receives some
          <lb/>Nourishment from the Earth, these Lohes, in all except those
          <lb/>os the Pulse Kind, hecome the Folia Seminalis, or Seed-leaves,
          <lb/>which still serve to protect the young Plant from injuries; but,
          <lb/>as soon as it has taken sufficient Root in the Earth to shift for
          <lb/>itself,' the Plant may he sain to he born; and then these Seedleaves,
          <lb/>heing of no farther Use, wither find drop off, like the
          <lb/>aforesaid Membranes in. Animals,</p>
        <p rend="indent">Without these Lobes, and somewhat above the thicker End
          <lb/>of the Bean, stands the Radicle, which' is so call'd, because,
          <lb/>upon the Vegetation os the Seed,’ it becomes the Root Of the
          <lb/>Plant. Now this is immediately Visible, upon diVesting the
          <lb/>Bean of its Coats, and is of a winter Colour, and more glosty,
          <lb/>than the main Body, especially in a young. Bean.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The next Part to be consider’d in the Plume, which lies inclosed
          <lb/>in two small Cavities, form'd in the Lobes of the Bean
          <lb/>for its Reception. Its Colour. comes near to that os the Radicle,
          <lb/>to the Basis of which it is fix'd;; tho" it has quite a
          <lb/>contrary Germination, that is; towards the thin End of the Bean ;</p>
        <p rend="hanging">and this is that Part, which, in Process os Time,- hecomes the
          <lb/>Body <hi>or</hi> Trunk ofthe Vegetable. . 's</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is not, like the Radiole, one entire Body, but is divided at
          <lb/>its loose End into divers Pieces, all close set together, like Feathers,
          <lb/>in a Bunch, whence it derives its Name ; and these are
          <lb/>so Very close, that only two or three of the outermost are, at
          <lb/>first. Visible; but, upon a nice and curious Separation, others
          <lb/>still more inward may he discover’d ; all which are so many true
          <lb/>Leaves, already form'd, tho’ not display’d, intended for the said
          <lb/>Trunk, and folded up with it, as afterwards appears upon the
          <lb/>sprouting of the Bean. In a <hi>French</hi> Bean the two outermost
          <lb/>-of these are Very fair and conspicuous ; and in a great Gardenbean
          <lb/>two Very small Plumes frequendy, if. not always, stand one
          <lb/>on each Side the great one just now described, from which they
          <lb/>differ in nothing but the Size. In many Sheds, indeed, nothing
          <lb/>hut the Trunk is Visible, - without any Leaves; notwithstanding</p>
        <p>which these last never sail to exert themselves, after the Seed
          <lb/>has lain some time in the Ground. The Seed, thus composed,
          <lb/>is inclosed within two common Membranes, the outer thin, and
          <lb/>the inner thicker; and one proper, winch we shall call the Cuticle,
          <lb/>which covers heth the Outside and Inside of the Lobes, as.
          <lb/>also the Radicle and Plume.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But, before we proceed any farther in the Description of the
          <lb/>different Parts of Plants, it will be highly worth while to take.
          <lb/>Notice of the great Analogy there is betwixt Plants and Animass,
          <lb/>in as few Words as may he.</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>First</hi>, then, as a Mixture of Male and Female is necessary
          <lb/>in Animals towards Generation, so it is in Plants, as appears,
          <lb/>beyond all manner os Contradiction, by a great Number of Experiments.
          <lb/></p>
        <p rend="indent">Again, as the first perceivable Effect of the Mixture of Sexes,
          <lb/>in Animals, is the Production os an Egg, which is deposited in
          <lb/>the Matrix or Womb of the Female Parent; or else laid in a
          <lb/>Nest, to be hatch'd by the Heat of the Mother's Body; or perhaps
          <lb/>conceal'd by the Parent in some proper Place, in order to
          <lb/>be brought to Perfection by the Heat os the Sun : It is just the.
          <lb/>same in Plants, where the first effect of the Mixture of Sexes
          <lb/>is the Production of a Seed, which may Very properly he call'd
          <lb/>the Egg of the Plant; which, when deposited in the Earth, aS a
          <lb/>proper Matrix orWomb, is, in its Season, as it were, hatch'd by
          <lb/>the Heat of the Sun, and becomes a Plant of the same Species,
          <lb/>as its Parent. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Embryo of Animais, whilst in the Egg, is inclosed in
          <lb/>Membranes, and is nourish’d by a Juice contain'd in the Egg,
          <lb/>which it receives by means of a Navel-string, or something that
          <lb/>performs the Office thereof; heing first collected by a Congee
          <lb/>tries or great Number Of Vessels, which is call'd the Placenta,
          <lb/>or, in some Animals, the Cotyledons. In the Seeds of Plants,
          <lb/>also, the Embryo is contain’d in Membranes, and the infant
          <lb/>Plant is for some time nourish'd by Vessels analogous to the
          <lb/>Navel-string, and Placenta, or Cotyledons, which convey to
          <lb/>the Embryo proper Nourishment. ‘i</p>
        <p rend="indent">When the Animal is born, or hatch'd, the Way of. its Nourishment
          <lb/>is then very different from what it was in the Egg;
          <lb/>for then there are a great Number of small Vessels, call'd by
          <lb/>Anatomists Lacteals, which take up, from the Intestines, the
          <lb/>finest Parts of the Aliment or Food which the Animal eats, and
          <lb/>convey it to the Blood-Vessels, where it circulates with the rest:
          <lb/>of the Juices, till it is again discharged from the Animal by <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
          <lb/>means of Perspiration, Urine, or some other Evacuation. III
          <lb/>Plants, the Fibres of the Root perform the Office of theDacteaisj
          <lb/>and convey Nourishment to the Plant ; which, aster having circulated
          <lb/>in its Vessels, is again thrown off by Perspiration.: And,
          <lb/>as curious Observers have found, that a Man in Health perspires
          <lb/>aheut thirty-one Ounces in twenty-four Hours; fo Dr. Halen
          <lb/>has demonstrated by Experiment, that a Sun-flower perspires
          <lb/>twenty-two Ounces in the same Time; not that the Sun-flower
          <lb/>is the only Plant that perspires, nor a Man the only Animal;
          <lb/>but all Plants and Animals throw off vast Quantities of their
          <lb/>Juices by Perspiration, some more, and some less, when in
          <lb/>Health. - : -<space type="tab"> </space>- -'si</p>
        <p rend="indent">Is the Air necessary to the Support of Animals ? It is not less
          <lb/>so to the Life of Vegetables; for all Plants whatever will soon
          <lb/>wither and die, when deprived of a: free Intercourse with the

          <lb/>piter</hi>.</p>
        <p>The Lobes, as. we have already observed, answer’ the same
          <lb/>Purposes as the Membranes in Animal Fcetufes; for hetween
          <lb/>these the tender Embryo is warmly and safely lodged, herd by
          <lb/>that means secured from all external Injuries, whicssit imight
          <lb/>otherwise sustain from the Mould,1 or the Access * of noxious
          <lb/>Colds; and this is continued till the little Plant is somewhat inur’d
          <lb/>to its new Element, and its Root tolerably fix'd in the Ground,
          <lb/>when these two Lobes-hecome the Folia Seminalia, or Seedleaves,
          <lb/>whose Office it is still to protect the tender Plant, till
          <lb/>the Plume is become fufficientiy strong and expanded. -. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Nor is this the only End they answer; for while they'adhere
          <lb/>to the little Embryo, they not only guard and desend it in the
          <lb/>ahove-mention'd manner, but likewise prepare and Purify the.
          <lb/>cruder Juioe the Plant is to receive from the Earth, by straining
          <lb/>it thro' their own Body, and assimilating it to their own Nature;
          <lb/>which Nourishment the littie Plant’receives, and draws
          <lb/>to itself by a great Number os small branchingVesseis, which
          <lb/>it sends into the Body os the Placenta, and which answer the </p>
        <pb n="38"/>
        <p>same Purposes as the <hi>Funes Umbilicales</hi>, or Navel-strings, in
          <lb/>Animals.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Moreover, we find thet every Placenta or Cotyledon of a
          <lb/>Seed abounds for the most part with a Balsam, disposed in
          <lb/>proper Celis, which is oily and tenacious, and not only serves
          <lb/>to defend the Embryo from any extraneous Moisture, hut, by
          <lb/>Its Viscidity, to entangle and retain that fine, pure, volatile
          <lb/>Spirit, which is the ultimate Production of the Plant., and
          <lb/>which is call’d the <hi>Spiritus Pector</hi>, or <hi>Prevailing Spirit.</hi>
          <lb/>This Oil, it is true, is never observed to enter into the
          <lb/>Vessels of the Embryo, which are too sine to admit (o
          <lb/>thick a Fluid; but the Spirit, being quicken’d by an active
          <lb/>Tower, may probably breathe that vital Principle into the
          <lb/>Juices which nourish the Embryo, which stamps upon it
          <lb/>the Charailer which distinguishes the Family; after which
          <lb/>every thing is changed into the Nature of that particular
          <lb/>Plant.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But, hefore we dismiss the Seed, it may not be improper to
          <lb/>observe, thet every Plant, even the least and most inconsiderable,
          <lb/>arises from a Seed, nor is produced any other way ; for,
          <lb/>tho’ the Earth nourishes every Individual, yet it cannot form
          <lb/>an organical Body ; and indced, if it could, it must be endow’d
          <lb/>with all the Omnipotence of the Creator:</p>
        <p rend="indent">Having thus taken a View of the Seed, we come next to
          <lb/>the Root, or that Part of a Plant, by which it adheres to the
          <lb/>Earth, and receives its Nourishment; but, before we proceed
          <lb/>in our Anatomy, it may not he amirs to observe, that the Roots
          <lb/>of Plants being of various Forms, are accordingly distinguished
          <lb/>by Botanists. Bee the Explications of the different Roots under
          <lb/>this Article.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But notwithstanding these Varieties, in regard to Matter of
          <lb/>Form, the essential Parts of the Root seem to be the same in
          <lb/>all; and are,</p>
        <p rend="indent">I. The Bark.</p>
        <p rend="hanging">2. The Wood, or signous Body; or, in the more herbaceous
          <lb/>Plants, something equivalent to it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">a. The Medulla, or Pith.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Bark, the Wool, and the pith of the Root, seem to be
          <lb/>nothing different from those of the Trunk and Branches. Its
          <lb/>Use is to receive the nutritious Juices of the Earth into its Vessels,
          <lb/>which are thence convey’d into the Trunk by corresponding
          <lb/>Vessels therein; or, according to the Opinion of seme, the

        <p rend="indent">The woody Fibres are certain tubular Bodies, hallow for the

        <p rend="indent">The woody Fibres are exactly the lame as in the Bark, only
          <lb/>there is this Difference hetween them, that, upon cursing the

        <p rend="indent">The little Bladders are rank’d in Lines, hetween the Fibres
          <lb/>and Vessels, from the Bark to the Pith ; tho* they do not all
          <lb/>extend quite so far, being sometimes interrupted bv little Cir"
          <lb/>oles, which rise towards the inmost Parts of the Wood.. In
          <lb/>Shrubs., and these which have not a very thick woody Body,
          <lb/>and are pretty pithy, these Bladders are visibly extended as far as
          <lb/>the Pith, and refolve themselves into it, whence it plainly appears,
          <lb/>that the Bladders in the Bark, and those in the Pith, are
          <lb/>of the fiime Nature: They are composed os oval Bodies, which
          <lb/>communicate one with another; whence they are swell’d with
          <lb/>the Juice of the Plant, in some with a lirupid, in others with a
          <lb/>tinctur’d Liquor. Each Bladder consists of a. fine transparent
          <lb/>Membrane ; and, in different Plants, they are very different,
          <lb/>both in Numher, Siae, Texture, and Extension.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Vessels containing the proper and essential Juice of the
          <lb/>Plant are disposed- in as many Circles as there are Coats, or
          <lb/>Strata, of annual increase from the Pith to the Bark ; for these
          <lb/>Strata are the fame with the inner Parts of the Bark, which
          <lb/>every Year apply themielves to the Wood, being rendered thus
          <lb/>compaft by the Pressure of the woody Fibres, which surround
          <lb/>them, on all Sides.</p>
        <p>The Air-vessels consist of certain spiral Lines, each of which
          <lb/>is cornndfed of a great many squamous parallel Fibres, and of a
          <lb/>great Numhet.of smaller Fibres, which run across these, and
          <lb/>cover them in the manner of a Coat. ....</p>
        <p rend="indent">These Air-pipes contain, as is were, certain pulmonary Vefseisand,
          <lb/>where they. communicate one with another, are
          <lb/>fiainejdinss of an oval Form, and always closed at rhe other End,
          <lb/>so that they bear <hi>νβ</hi>.. small Resemblance to the Vessels in. the

          <lb/>Plants and Insects, instead of Lungs, these fpiral Vessels, thus
          <lb/>composed of hellow squamous Fibres, for the better hearing the
          <lb/>sudden Pressure and Dilatation of the Air, in those violent Fled

          <lb/>shinetimes streighten’d by the wondy Fibres., whence, on cutting
          <lb/>the Wood across, .their Orifices frequently appear oval or round,
          <lb/>arid sometimes.angular. They run up' almost in right Lines
          <lb/>from she <hi>Root</hi> to the Trunk, whence they are dispersed thro*
          <lb/>the Branches, and, growing curved in the Leaves, are .interwoven
          <lb/>in the manner of a Net. Thefe Vessels, except rhe Saju
          <lb/>' volherof the Bark, are by rar the largest of all, and occur in
          <lb/>grcatTlenty thio’ the whole Substance of the Wood j but none
          <lb/>have ever been observed in the Bark.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Pith,, witch was formerly look’d upon as analogous to
          <lb/>the Heart anil strain in Animals, consists of a great Numher of
          <lb/>stttio Globules, rank’d lengthways. These Globules, which

          <lb/>; for the little Bladders, which form that spongy Substance,
          <lb/>run quite from the Bark thio’ the woody Fibres, and
          <lb/>and in the Pith,. whence it is plain, they partake of the same
          <lb/>Nature t- And,, indced, they differ in nothing but Siae, the Vestoles
          <lb/>os the Pith being very large, those os the Bark lest, and
          <lb/>these of the Wood the smallest of alt The Quantity of Pith is
          <lb/>likewise different in various Plants; and is, in general, more in

          <lb/>than in. Trees: It. may am distinguish’d into he Vesicis and
          <lb/>Bladders , the first of which are placed at the Extremities of the
          <lb/>Pith, which they circle round, and embrace. These Vessels
          <lb/>contain the propel and essential Juice of the Plant.</p>
        <p>The Bladders of the Pith are likewise of different-Magnitndes
          <lb/>in different Plants, at least an hundred times larger in
          <lb/>some than in others ; as in the common Thistle, for Example,
          <lb/>than in the Oake And it most also he observed, that the Size;

        <p>sor in the Pith of the Elder-tree, which is more, in .Quantity
          <lb/>than that of the Berberry-tree, the Bladders which compose it
          <lb/>are aS small again aS those of the latter.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Pith is only succulent or sappy the first Year, its Bladders,
          <lb/>aster that, growing dry, lax, and soft; and this Sap it
          <lb/>probably receives from the reticular Veffeis which surround it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Texture of the Branch is exactly the same with that of
          <lb/>the Trunk. * . . </p>
        <p rend="indent">But here we must not forget two Very material Parts, remark'd
          <lb/>by the curious Observers of Nature; and these are the
          <lb/>'Knots, and the Buds. ' -</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Knots are those Parts of a Plant in which the Buds are
          <lb/>lodged, and from whence it shoots out its Branches. ‘ They not
          <lb/>only serve as Abutments for the dilating Sap to exert its Torch
          <lb/>upon, but also to prevent the rarery’d Sap’s too free Retreat
          <lb/>from the Pith.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Buds, to use Mr. <hi>Bradlefls</hi> Words, have their first Rife
          <lb/>in the Pith; they are there framed, and aS they become fit for
          <lb/>Action, by being furnish’d with every necessary Part for Vegetation,
          <lb/>they are forced along certain Chaneis, till they meet the
          <lb/>Air at.the tender Bark, thro’ which they make their Way, and
          <lb/>would drop to the Ground, were they not restrain'd by a Numher
          <lb/>of Sap-veffeis, winch serve aS so many Roots to nourish
          <lb/>them from the Body of the Tree. These Buds are, in every
          <lb/>respect, as perfect as the Seed, or rather more so; for a Bud
          <lb/>contains a whole Plant, roll'd up in itself; and has, for the most
          <lb/>part, its Juices so well digested, aS to come sooner to bear Fruit
          <lb/>than the Plant wrapp’d up in the Seed.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Difference hetween a Bud and a Seed is, that a Seed
          <lb/>consists, of Lobes and Ear-leaves, which include the young
          <lb/>Plant, andTerVe to give it the first Stamp, by teaching it what
          <lb/>kind of Juices it ought to draw from the Earth for its Nourishtnent:
          <lb/>But a Bud has no Occasion for such Ear-leaves, hecause
          <lb/>it takes Root immediately in the Body of the Tree, where .the
          <lb/>Juices are already sit sor it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Buds likewise differ from Seeds, inasmuch as they are always
          <lb/>constant to the Mother-tree, and exact Representatives of the
          <lb/>Plant that produced them ; whereas Seeds multiply their own
          <lb/>Species, with Variety of Complexions, all the Plants produced
          <lb/>by them being some way different from one another, either by
          <lb/>some littie Variation in the Colour os the Flower, the Taste,
          <lb/>or Time of ripening of their Fruit, the Flower or Figure os it,
          <lb/>- or some Difference in the Shape or Colour of the Leaves. And
          <lb/>Nature, in this respect, - seems to observe the same Conduct as
          <lb/>amongst Animals, where no two Faces are exactly alike ; and
          <lb/>where no Offspring perfectly resembles either Mother or Sire. .,</p>
        <p rend="indent">This constant Likeness, therefore, of the Plant, proceeding
          <lb/>from the Bud to the Mother-tree, seems aS if design'd on purpose
          <lb/>to support the Reputation of the Mother-plant, and, in some
          <lb/>measure, to make amends to Plants sor their Deficiency in the
          <lb/>want os local Motion ; fince, by the Bud, any particular Fruit,
          <lb/>Or Tree of Merit, may come to be naturaliz'd in any Part of
          <lb/>the World. ...... / ” “δ᾽</p>
        <p rend="indent">But it must he observ'd, that the Buds are of several Sorts,
          <lb/><hi>vix</hi>. either Leaf-buds, or Blossom-buds.. The Difference between
          <lb/>them may be known in most forts of Fruit-trees, before
          <lb/>they open, by observing, that the Leaf-buds are long, thin,
          <lb/>and pointed ; but the Blossom-buds short 'and turgid. The
          <lb/>Juices also, in the first, are inore fluent and aqueous; and, in the
          <lb/>latter, more digested and gummy. But both these sorts of Buds
          <lb/>proceed from the Pith of the young Wood, and are disposed for
          <lb/>different Offices, as the Plant or Branches that produce them
          <lb/>are more or less Vigorous. The most Vigorous bring Leaf-buds,
          <lb/>and thofe that are smaller, and seem to be less nourish'd, produce
          <lb/>Blossom-buds. ’</p>
        <p rend="indent">They are spread into Branches, when the Temper of she
          <lb/>Air is such, as to render the Sap or Juices of the Plant of suchX
          <lb/>Fluidity as to cuculate thro' the Veffeis without Interruptions
          <lb/>. when the Sap, heing sussicientiy fluid, fills the Buds, and they,
          <lb/>by degrees, are open'd into Shoots and Branches, every one of
          <lb/>which is properly a Tree growing upon another Tree ; which
          <lb/>makes it practicable to cut off Branches from any Tree, where
          <lb/>we please, without destroying the Tree; whereas, if a Tree
          <lb/>was one entire Body, as the <hi>Body of an</hi> Animal, the cutting
          <lb/>off the Branch would endanger the Whole.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But the Buds are not confin'd to the Parts above Ground
          <lb/>only, being fram'd in the Pith of the Root, as well aS in that
          <lb/>os any other Part ; and here it is worthy our Notice, that those
          <lb/>which are form'd in the Root,- are impress’d with the Form of the
          <lb/>Root, when put in Action ; and so those Buds winch are form'd
          <lb/>in the Branches, are also medel'd for Branches, when they he-:
          <lb/>gin to act; bus, in their Principles, they are both the same.
          <lb/>For if we expose the Roots of a Tree to the Air, after allow-'
          <lb/>ing them a little Time to be acquainted with the Element, they
          <lb/>will put out Buds in such sort, as to produce Leaves ; and is
          <lb/>we lay down a Branch of a Tree in the Earth, after It has had
          <lb/>time to reconcile itfelf to that Situation, those Buds form'd in
          <lb/>the Pith, when they begin to move, instead of Leaves, or
          <lb/>Flowers, or Fruit, which they would have produc'd, if raised

        <p>And hence it is likewise observable, that as the Pish, of <hi rend="sup">C0B</hi>sequence,

          <lb/>increase a Tree by Layers, those Layers must he os the young

        <p>The Leaf consists of the same Parts as the Trunk and
          <lb/>Branches, that is; woody Fibres, orLympheducts, Vessels containing
          <lb/>the specific Juice os the Plant, Air-vessels, a Parenchyma,
          <lb/>or Ranks of little Bladders, which fill up the Spaces between
          <lb/>the reticular Fibres, and a Cuticle ; all which are substantially
          <lb/>the same with those of the Branches: For the Cuticle of the
          <lb/>Leaf, for Example, is no more than the Amplification of that
          <lb/>oTthe Branch; as the Fibres or Nerves, dispersed thro’ the
          <lb/>Leas, are only the Ramifications of the Wood of the Branch,
          <lb/>or lignous Body. So likewise the Parenchyma of the Loaf,
          <lb/>which lies betwixt the Nerves, and filis all up, is nothing else
          <lb/>but the Continuations of the cortical Body, or the inner Part os
          <lb/>the Bark, from the Branch into itself; as in most Plants, with <hi rend="sup">a</hi>
          <lb/>fat Leaf, may easily he discern'd. For it must be observed,
          <lb/>that the Stalk of the Leaf, which is composed of all these,
          <lb/>where it enters the Leaf, divides itself, like another Trunk,
          <lb/>into a great Number of Branches; and these again are subdivided
          <lb/>into a great many lesser Branches or Twigs, which mutually
          <lb/>crossing each other, .compose a kind of Nur-work, which
          <lb/>is Very Visible in the Leaves of some Plants, particularly on the
          <lb/>back Side of those of Sage.</p>
        <p rend="indent">That these Fibres are likewise accompanied by the Vessels
          <lb/>containing the specific Juice of the Plans, is evident from the
          <lb/>different Colour of their Contents, which discovers itself upon
          <lb/>Dissection of the Leaves, as a Milk in those os Spurge and Suecory,
          <lb/>and in those of Celandine a yellowish Liquid. And the'
          <lb/>this is not so apparent in the Leaves of many Plants, where these
          <lb/>Veffeis are only full of a limpid aqueous Fluid, yet the aforesaid
          <lb/>Instances are sufficient to Convince us,. that they are present in
          <lb/>all.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Spaces between these Veffeis and Fibres, being fill’d up
          <lb/>by the above-mention'd little Bladders, form the Parenchyma,
          <lb/>or fleshy Part of the Leaf; and these Bladders, according to the
          <lb/>Nature of the Sap they contain, and the Closeness or Laxity of
          <lb/>their Pores, are of different Figures upon the Surface of the
          <lb/>Leaf, as in some angular, in others quite irregular.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Between these Bladders and the reticular Fibres, <hi>Mulpighi</hi>
          <lb/>observes, that there are several little Cells or Pores dispersed,
          <lb/>which serve sor the Discharge of some Fluid, or the Exhalation
          <lb/>of some Vapour.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Whole is cover'd with a fine Cuticle, or Epidermis,

          <lb/>Cup ; for the Calix is properly the hollow Cup form'd by the
          <lb/>Perianthium, or Empalement, out of which the other Parts of
          <lb/>the Flower grow. There are some Flowers whose Petals, or
          <lb/>Flower-leaves, .heve a sum and strong Basis, sufficient to sup-.
          <lb/>port themselves, and therefore stand in need os no Empalement
          <lb/>or Perianthium ; and accordingly Nature has given them none,
          <lb/>as may be seen in the Tulip. These, however, have a Calix
          <lb/>or Cup.‘</p>
        <p rend="indent">By the Foliation Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> means the Assemblage of the
          <lb/>Petala, or those finely colour’d Flower-leaves, which constitute
          <lb/>the Beauty of the Flower. These Petala, or Flower-leaves,
          <lb/>grow generally immediately within the Perianthium, or.Einpaleil
          <lb/>inent, from the'Edges of the Calix or Cup, and inclose the Attire,
          <lb/>or Male and Female Parts of the Flower. Some Flowers
          <lb/>consist of one Petal, or Flower-leaf, and are <hi>of</hi> different Shapes
          <lb/>in different Plants, as that of a Bell, or a Funnel; and sometimes
          <lb/>of two, three, four, or five Petais ; and sometimes of a
          <lb/>Number, as in the Marygold and Sun-flower.</p>
        <p>There is a large Class of Plants which have no Petals at all,
          <lb/>and therefore are call'd apetalous, as Hops, Mercury, Netties,
          <lb/>and Docks, These are also call'd stamineous Flowers, from
          <lb/>their great Number of Stamina or Chives.</p>
        <p rend="indent">These Petais are design'd by Nature for the Safeguard of the
          <lb/>Parts Of Generation in the Flower; and hence we see them
          <lb/>expand themselves at the Rising of the Sun, to receive the
          <lb/>Heat ; and close up, some more, others less, at the Approach
          <lb/>of Rain or Night. Nor is this their only Office; they also
          <lb/>draw arid convey Nourishment to the Embryo; Fruits, and
          <lb/>Seeds; for as soon as the Pistil is form'd into a small Fruit, now
          <lb/>impregnated with its minute'seminal Tree, furnish’d with its
          <lb/>Secundines or Membranes, the Blossom falls off, leaving this
          <lb/>new-form'd egg, or first-set Fruit, to imbibe Nourishment for
          <lb/>itself, and the Foetus with winch it is impregnated ; which Nourishment
          <lb/>is brought within the Reach and Power of its Suction
          <lb/>by the adjoiningLeaves. </p>

        <p rend="indent">We now come to the generative Parts of Hants, call'd by

        <p rend="indent">in siome Flowers these Stamina are exceedingly short, and in

        <p rend="indent">in other Flowers, as the Thistle, and Lettuce, several
          <lb/>of these Stamina, uniting together, form a littie kind of Tuhe,

        <p rend="indent">Many and Very different are the Opininns of Authors, in
          <lb/>regard to the Generation of Plants: Without entering into their
          <lb/>- Disputes, we shall give that Account of it, which seems to us
          <lb/>most Probable ; after having observed, that, most Plants are Hermaphrodites,
          <lb/>among which some, and that the greatest Part of
          <lb/>them, contain both the Male and Female Parts of Generation
          <lb/>in the same Flower. Others, the Melon for Example, bear
          <lb/>Flowers upon the same Stem, Of different Sexes, the Female,
          <lb/>which produce Fruit, and the Male, which produce none. There
          <lb/>are also fome entire Plants, which bear Flowers without Fruit ;
          <lb/>whilst others, of the'same Species and Name, bear Fruit without
          <lb/>Flowers a and they are hence distinguish'd into Male and
          <lb/>Female Plants.: Of this last Kind are the Palm-tree, Poplar,
          <lb/>Hops and'Hemp. The Male are those which produce the
          <lb/>Flower, and the Female those which produce the Seed.</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Now 'tis highly probable, that the Embryo of the young
          <lb/>Plans, or that Part which we have hefore describ'd as lying in
          <lb/>the Middle of the Seed, and which we have distinguish'd into
          <lb/>the Radicle and Plume, is form'd by the <hi>Farina Jucundans,</hi>
          <lb/>which, falling down the.Pistil into the Uterus <hi>or</hi> Womb of the
          <lb/>Plant, meets there with a. proper Receptacle, where it fixes 4
          <lb/>and that the.Lobes of the Seed, above describ'd, which perform
          <lb/>the fame Office as the Membranes, Placenta, Cotyledons, or
          <lb/>After-birth,- do to the Young Of Animals, <hi>are</hi> furnish'd by the
          <lb/>Female Part, of the Plant</p>
        <p rend="indent">When, the Male and Female Parts of the Flower arepretty
          <lb/>near to each other, it is not difficult to conceive,, hew
          <lb/>the <hi>Farina Jucundans, or</hi>, as it may he calPd, the Male Sperm,
          <lb/>is convey'd to the Pistil, or Womb : But when the Male and
          <lb/>Female Flowers are at a Distance from each other upon the.same
          <lb/>Stern, but more particularly when they grow upon different.
          <lb/>Plants of the same Species, it is not so easy to comprehend how
          <lb/>the. impregnating Dust of the Male Plant is convey'd to the
          <lb/>Female Plant, especially when they are at a great Distance from
          <lb/>each other... ....</p>
        <p rend="indent">We have a Story in <hi>s.ovianus Pontanus</hi>, which will give the
          <lb/>Reader an Idea of the vast Distances to which this impregnating
          <lb/>Dust may be carried. He tells us, that there was a Female
          <lb/>Palm-tree which grew in tho Wood of <hi>Otranto</hi>, and a Male
          <lb/>Palm-tree at <hi>Brindisi</hi>, fifteen Leagues from the Female , that
          <lb/>. VOL. I,</p>
        <p>the Female was barren for several Years, and bore no Fruit at
          <lb/>all ; till at last growing above the other Trees of the Wood, it
          <lb/>began to he fruitful, and. bone great Quantities, tho' there was
          <lb/>no other Male Palm-tree nearer than that at <hi>Bryndist</hi>.</p>
        <p>Most Authors, that have treated of the Generation of Plants,,
          <lb/>have quoted this History ; and, I think, generally agree, that
          <lb/>the Male Dust must be brought from the MaleTree at <hi>Brindisi,</hi>
          <lb/>to the Female at <hi>Otranto</hi>, by the Wind ; and therefore conclude,
          <lb/>that the Wind is the Agent which carries the Dust from the
          <lb/>Male Plant to the Female... This would he very probable, provided
          <lb/>these Palm-frees grew betwixt the Tropics, where the
          <lb/>Wind, for at least three Parts of the Year, blows from the East,
          <lb/>and the Situation Us the Male Tree had been towards the East
          <lb/>of the Female; hut if the Female had been placed East of the
          <lb/>Male, it would have proved a .Very unfortunate Position for the
          <lb/>Female, which mush therefore have certainly heen barren.</p>
        <p>For my own part, I don't think it probable, that the Supreme
          <lb/>Being, whe always orders all the Operations of Nature to be
          <lb/>perform'd in the best manner, should leave a Thing of so much
          <lb/>Consequence, as that of the Generation of Plants, to be conducted
          <lb/>by so uncertain an Agent as the Wind ; which would
          <lb/>undoubtedly leave a great Numher of. Plants barren, is it did
          <lb/>dot happen to blow from a right Point, just at the Time .'that
          <lb/>the Dust of the Male, being arrived at Maturity, was ready to
          <lb/>he carried to the Female Plant. . . .</p>
        <p>I arn therefore of Opinion, that there is some Power in Nature,
          <lb/>which has not yet been duly consider’d by the Learned,
          <lb/>, capable of affording so sure a Conveyance to the Main Dust,
          <lb/>that it can never fail impregnating the Female.</p>
        <p>There is a Power in Nature to which Philosophers have given
          <lb/>’ the Name of <hi>Electricity</hi>, because first observed in Amber, call'd
          <lb/>in Latin, <hi>Electrum</hi>. This is an attractive or magnetic Force,
          <lb/>which the aforesaid Amber, Glass, and many other Bodies,
          <lb/>exert, when rubb'd till they' are warm, and by which they draw
          <lb/>to themselves any light Body that is near them, and sometimes
          <lb/>repel the said Bodies from them. Mr. <hi>Gray</hi>, of our own Royal
          <lb/>Society, and Monsieur <hi>du Fay</hi>, of the' <hi>French</hi> Academy of
          <lb/>Sciences, have, by their indefatigable Researches, discover'd
          <lb/>many amazing Properties of electrical Bodies, too long to enumerate
          <lb/>in this Place. But it is very much to our present Purpose
          <lb/>to observe, that Bees-wax is endued with this attractive
          <lb/>Power, at least as much as any other Body whatever,' and that
          <lb/>without any rubbing at all; and this electrical .or attractive
          <lb/>Force Bees-wax retains longer than any other Body. </p>
        <p rend="indent">Now, if we consider, that Bees-wax is littie more than <hi>ai
          <lb/>Mass of</hi> the ’ <hi>Farina smcundans</hi>, or impregnating Dust of
          <lb/>Flowers, collected by the Bees, it seems very likely, that
          <lb/>every Particle of this was endu'd with a certain electrical or
          <lb/>attractive Force, before it was gather'd from the Flower ; and
          <lb/>if so, why may we not presume, that the Pistil or Womb of
          <lb/>the Plant, and the <hi>FarinafcEcundans</hi>, or impregnating Dust,
          <lb/>strongly attract each other? And as some Bodies are known
          <lb/>to exert an attractive Force to a prodigious Distance, we may
          <lb/>easily conceive; that it inpossible for the <hi>Farina s.acundans</hi> of
          <lb/>a Male Palm to sail, even against the Wind, from <hi>Brindisi</hi> to
          <lb/><hi>Otranto</hi>, though fifteen Leagues. asunder, when the Female
          <lb/>Palm was grown high enough to receive the <hi>Farina</hi>, which,
          <lb/>before that, would be intercepted in. its Passage by the other
          <lb/>Trees of the Forrest. . . .</p>
        <p rend="indent">There are some Circumstances relating to Electricity, which
          <lb/>seem to confirm, that what we have hinted at is, at least, one
          <lb/>of its principal Uses. *One in, that this electrical Virtue of
          <lb/>Bedies is much diminish'd by?a moist Ait. Another is, that
          <lb/>it does not exert itself so Vigorously, during the Heat os the
          <lb/>- Day. ' \ '/</p>
        <p rend="indent">Curious Observers of Nature will discover, upon Examination,
          <lb/>that the Generation of Plants is principally curried on in

          <lb/>heen risen long enough to dry in seine measure the Air, and
          <lb/>elevate the Vapours to some Distance from the Surface of the

        <p><hi>Of the Vegetation or Growth of Plants</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In order to form some Idea of the Vegetation of Plants, it
          <lb/>will not be amiss to consider the. Preduction ossa Plant as the
          <lb/>Result of a Chymical Process, in winch Nature in the Operater,
          <lb/>and the Person who cultivates the Ground an Assistant.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The first thing then, that is done, is to manure the Land, or,
          <lb/>in other Words, to furnish in with an alcaline Salt. Here
          <lb/>we must suppose, that the Earth m be manur'd was hefore de-i
          <lb/>pric'd os all its Salts, by bearing Too frequent Crops, otherwise
          <lb/>this Part of the Operation would be unnecessary , Nature urt- </p>
        <pb n="41"/>
        <p rend="indent">assisted heing abundantly sufficient to supply the Ground with
          <lb/>a due Quantity of Salts ; but, when these are taken away. Nature
          <lb/>unaided is a long tone in providing more.</p>
        <p rend="indent">These Salts, while they retain their al<hi rend="u">calin</hi>e Nature according
          <lb/>to their known Property, divide she Earth into small Particles,
          <lb/>and render it light, and disposed to crumble and fall in
          <lb/>Pieces, like Laine, when Water is pour’d upon it . and thereby
          <lb/>promote its Fertility. It is for thi<hi rend="sup">S</hi> very Reason that frequent
          <lb/>Ploughing, or Digging,-fertilizes the Ground, and is
          <lb/>what People mean when they talk of <hi>making it mellow</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When this is done. Nature furnishes these alcaline Salts
          <lb/>with a Fluid to dissolve them, that is, they attract strongly
          <lb/>the Vapours and Dews floating in the Ain, which have already
          <lb/>heen render’d somewhat oily, by the Oils of Animals
          <lb/>and Vegetables, which perpetually float in the Atmosphere:
          <lb/>By these oily Dews, they are dissolv’d into a kind of Oil,
          <lb/><hi>pcr Deliquium</hi>, and sink into the Bosom of the Earth, which
          <lb/>. may be esteem'd aS the Vessel in which this Operation, or Process
          <lb/>os Vegetation, is perform’d; and here again they meet
          <lb/>with an Oil, of which all Earths contain more or less.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It has been observ’d under the Article ALCALINE, that
          <lb/>if Salts are mix’d with any Acid, especially when in a
          <lb/>fluid State, an Effervescence is . raised, with Ebullition, and
          <lb/>a violent intestine Motion; and thet they attracithe Acid
          <lb/>of the Air so strongly, as in time to he impregnated therewith,
          <lb/>and to become entirely neutral. It is then easy to nnderstand,
          <lb/>that whilst these Salts lip in the Bosom of the Earth,
          <lb/>dissolv’d into what the Chymists call an Oil <hi>per Deliquium,</hi>’
          <lb/>or, in other Words, a <hi>Lixivium</hi> or <hi>Lye</hi>, as they gradually atι
          <lb/>trail the Acid of the. Ain, a gentle Effervescence, or Ebullition,
          <lb/>must be caused, which must divide and break those Parts
          <lb/>. of the Soil, which before cohered strongly together, and render
          <lb/>the Earth yet more light and mellow: \</p>
        <p>Now let us call to mind, that when alcaline Salts are digested
          <lb/>"..with an Oil, they intimately unite with it, and form a pene-</p>
        <p rend="indent">trating deterging Substance, which is dissoluble in Water,
          <lb/>anil is <hi>of</hi> a Nature very differens, both from the component
          <lb/>alcaline Salt, and Oil; and this is commonly called Soap.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When therefore these alcaline Salts are committed to the
          <lb/>Earth, and dissolv’d into a kind of <hi>sue, meeting</hi> there with
          <lb/>an Oil, thefe Salts and this Oil are digested by the Heat of the
          <lb/>Sun, united together,' and converted into a Soap much more
          <lb/>perfect than the artificial Sort we make use of; for this last
          <lb/>always retains some of the Acridness of its Parent Salt, which
          <lb/>renders it unfit for the Purposes of Vegetation till neutraliz’d;
          <lb/>whereas that form’d in the Soil is render’d entirely neutral as
          <lb/>it is made, the Salts attracting and imbibing the Acid of the
          <lb/>Ain, atthe fame time that they are miking with the Oils os the
          <lb/>Earth, in order to be transform’d into a Soap. See Acetum.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As all Vegetables whatever contain a large Quantity of
          <lb/>Earth, it feerns at first View somewhat difficult to explain,
          <lb/>how it should be able to get there ; because the Pores of the

          <lb/>even of Water; or, if they would admit Water, w<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

          <lb/>Earth comes to be dissolv’d, and render’d capable of entering

          <lb/>to explain.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Solution of a Body is nothing more then dividing it

          <lb/>the Menstruum, Water, as to become invisible whilst they
          <lb/>float in it. Now the dividing the Earth mio small Particles,
          <lb/>in the manner just above-rnentionin, is One Step towards a</p>
        <p rend="indent">Solution.:- .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Let us now consider the saponaceous neutral Juice, form’d
          <lb/>in the Earth by an alcaline Salt, an Oil, and the Acid of the
          <lb/>Air, as <hi>a</hi>. saponaceous or soapy Menstruum, or Solvent, andsee
          <lb/>hew it is capable of acting upon Earth; and, in order to
          <lb/>make this the more plain, we shall give a very obvious Example,
          <lb/>which falls under the Observation of every body.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When Cloaths, or Linen, or any thing else, are dirty, thet
          <lb/>is, have Concretions of Earth sticking to them, we find the
          <lb/>most effectual way to make them clean, is to wash them inWater
          <lb/>. wherein Soap has been dissolv’d. Here then Soap penetrates
          <lb/>the Pores of the Earth, divides it into excceding fine Particles,
          <lb/>and in some measure dissolves it. ‘ A saponaceous Fluid,
          <lb/>therefore, bids the fairest of any thing we are acquainted with,
          <lb/>to he the Menstruum or Solvent of Earth, and it is probable,
          <lb/>that the saponaceous Fluid which is made in the Bosom of tho
          <lb/>Earth by a long Digestion, is more penetrating than any artificial
          <lb/>Soap, and consequently more capable of dissolving
          <lb/>Earth.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We shall he still farther confirm’d in this Opinion, if we
          <lb/>consider this Juice of the Earth as <hi rend="sup">a</hi> neutral Menstruum or
          <lb/>Solvent; for it appears by a great Number of Chymical Experiments,
          <lb/>thet neutral Menstruums will dissolve <hi rend="sup">m</hi>2ny Bodies
          <lb/>or Substances, especially those thet are of <hi rend="u"><hi rend="sup">an</hi></hi> earthy Nature
          <lb/>which no other Menstruums Or Solvents will touch.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From whet has been said, it appears very plain, that wheg
          <lb/>the Earth has for a considerable time been, as it were, digeste
          <lb/>by the Heat of the Sun, in a saponaceous, neutral Liquor,
          <lb/>the Rains, fessing in great Quantities, dilute this saponaceous
          <lb/>Liquor more, extra# a kind of Tinctirre from the Earth, thet

          <lb/>Vegetation, which, entering the Pores of the Root, is carried,
          <lb/>into the Stem of the Plant; and by this means is brought

          <lb/>they, or any more modern Authors, have explain’d the Manner
          <lb/>how this Impregnation is brought about.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We have before observ’d a great Analogy betwixt Animals
          <lb/>and Vegetables. It will very much illustrate the ,Doctiine
          <lb/>aheady laid down, in regard to the Preparation of the
          <lb/>Food of Vegetables, that is, the Juices which enter their
          <lb/>Roots for their Nourishment, to explain the Ways which Nature-
          <lb/>takes to prepare the Food of Animals in their refpedhve
          <lb/>Stomachs.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There heve for many Ages been great Disputes amongst
          <lb/>Authors who heve wrote upon the Animal Oeconomy, concoming
          <lb/>the Digestion of Fond taken into the Stomach. Most
          <lb/>have agreed, that fome kind of Menstruum was necessary for
          <lb/>its Solution. Amongst thefe,- some heve affirm’d it to be an
          <lb/>alcaline Solvent,, feme an acid: There are others, who heve
          <lb/>attributed this Solution to a Ferment in the Stomach, and .
          <lb/>some heve imagin’d, thet Digestion was perform’d by Tritura-.
          <lb/>tion, or grinding, as it were, the Aliment, contain’d in the
          <lb/>Stomach, betwixt the Diaphragm and the Muscles of the Belly.
          <lb/>But <hi>Papin</hi>, and since him, many more tell us, that the All-'
          <lb/>ment is digested by the Heat of the Stomach, which, rarefying
          <lb/>the Air contain’d in the Food, breaks it into small Particles,
          <lb/>and reduces it into a Fluid. It would be endless to enter into
          <lb/>a Detail of all the Inconsistencies which have been broached
          <lb/>upon this Subject: I shall therefore content myself with observing,
          <lb/>thet it is probable, that the Saliva, <hi>or</hi> Spittle, together
          <lb/>with the Juices pour’cl into the Stomach out of its own
          <lb/>Glands, much of the fame Nature as the Saliva, furnish a
          <lb/>Menstruum or Dissolvent entirely neutral, of a penetrating saponaceous.
          <lb/>or foapy Nature, capable of dissolving the Aliment
          <lb/>by the Assistance of a gentle Heat, without having recourse
          <lb/>to an acid or alcaline Menstruum, Ferments, and Trituration.
          <lb/>When this Operation is perform’d in the Stomach, the
          <lb/>Aliment, thus far digested, is protruded by a gentle Pressute
          <lb/>from the Diaphragm and Muscles of the Belly into the Intestine,
          <lb/>or Gut, called by Anatomists the <hi>Duodenum</hi>, where it again
          <lb/>meets with a Fluid of all others, perhaps, the most saponaceous
          <lb/>and penetratiog, I mean the Blle, or, as it is usually called,
          <lb/>the Gall; and, miking therewith, undergoes a farther Solution,
          <lb/>is render’d more fluid, and fitted to enter the Mouths of the </p>

        <p rend="indent">That the Saliva, or Spittie, is of a saponaceous Nature, any
          <lb/>one will readily he convinc'd, that thinks it worth while to
          <lb/>try an easy Experiment ; for he will find, that Spittle will dissolve

          <lb/>it is to anoint the Part with Fasting-spittie : Now the good
          <lb/>Effect it has in these Cases, is owingsto its saponaceous, penetrating

        <p rend="indent">Gall is so commonly known to be a natural Soap, that it is
          <lb/>frequently used in Washing, especially that of Oxen, which
          <lb/>is easily procur'd, instead of artificial Soap.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is remarkable, that the Gall os Pikes, Eeis, and other

          <lb/>Other Animals enjoy, have a Gall the most penetrating and
          <lb/>saponaceous of all other Animals. See BiLISi</p>
        <p rend="indent">From what has been said about Digestion, it appears how

        <p rend="indent">This Subject must not be dismissed without animadverting
          <lb/>upon an Error of many Authors, who have compar'd the
          <lb/>Roots of Plants to the Stomachs of Animals, which seems to
          <lb/>be without the least Foundation ; for the Food <hi>of</hi> Plants, or
          <lb/>the Juices which are to circulate therein, are prepar’d in the
          <lb/>. Bosom of the Earth before they enter the Pores of the Root;
          <lb/>and the Office of the Root seems to be little more than to finnish
          <lb/>Conduits, or Pipes, to convey these Juices to the Stem ;
          <lb/>though it is probable, they may undergo some Alteration by
          <lb/>circulating in the Vessels of the Root.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The nutritious Juices of Plants being thus prepar'd in the
          <lb/>Bosom os the Earth, we are now to explain,show it comes
          <lb/>th pass, that they enter into the Seed. In order, to do this,
          <lb/>. we must observe, that all Bedies whatever are expanded, that
          <lb/>is, grow larger, by Heat. When therefore a Seed has lain all.
          <lb/>Winter in the Ground without any Signs of Germination, in
          <lb/>the Spring, as the Seed is distended by the Heat os the Sun
          <lb/>in all its Dimensions, though never so littie, there must be
          <lb/>fome Vacant Spaces within it; and, as Fluids press every Way,
          <lb/>the nutritious Juices in the Earth, with which the Seed is furrounded,
          <lb/>will enter "the Foramen, or Hole, which we have
          <lb/>describ'd to be at one End thereof, and fill up these Vacancies.
          <lb/>When they are once got within the Seed, being extremely
          <lb/>penetrating, they enter the Pores of the Cotyledons, or Lobes,
          <lb/>for the Very same Reason that they first enter'd the Seed.
          <lb/>From hence passing through the <hi>Funis umbilicalis</hi>, or Navelstrings,
          <lb/>they are communicated to the Radicle and Plume,
          <lb/>which are thereby distended, or, as it were; unfolded. And
          <lb/>thus is the Circulation in the Infant Plant carried on, till the
          <lb/>Radicle, by degrees extending- itself into the Earth, fixes there,
          <lb/>and becomes capable at last ofimmishing the whole Plant with
          <lb/>a nutritious Juice, whilst the Plume, shooting in a contrary
          <lb/>Direction, in a Very little time, flourishes above the Surface,of

        <p rend="indent">Some Gentlemen of the Royal Academy os Sciences, have
          <lb/>pretty much puzzled themselves, and their Readers, in endeavouring
          <lb/>to give the Reasons why the Plume ascends, and the
          <lb/>Radicle descends, when a Seed happens to be inverted in thej
          <lb/>Earth, which must often <hi>be</hi>- the Case, or, in other Words,when
          <lb/>the Plume, which ought to-tend upwards; lies lowermost,'
          <lb/>Or in any other Direction but perpendicular, <hi>viuri</hi> pointing to
          <lb/>the Surface of. the Earth. 'Tis certain, that Seeds of all
          <lb/>Kinds, from the smallest to the largest, tho’ thrown never so
          <lb/>confusedly into the Earth,: and - lying there in- all manner of
          <lb/>Directions, notwithstanding these Disadvantages, redress them-:
          <lb/>'selves when they come to spring and rise with the Plume per-:
          <lb/>pendicular to the Surface of the Earth ; and this-is one of
          <lb/>those amazing Instances of the Wisdom of Providence, which.
          <lb/>never leaves the Welfare of its Productions to- Chance, but
          <lb/>conducts the most inconsiderable Parts of the Creation with so i
          <lb/>much Art and Oeconomy, that the more we are acquainted
          <lb/>with it, the more we must admire it. It seems exceeding
          <lb/>easy to explain how this Perpendicularity is effected, if we
          <lb/>only consider, that, whilst the Radicle is fixing itself in the
          <lb/>Earth, the Plume lies betwixt the two Lobes, which Lobes
          <lb/>afterwards shoot out os the Ground, together with the Plume, ’
          <lb/>and become the seminal Leaves in all Plants, except those of
          <lb/>the Pulse Kind, which have something analogous to them.
          <lb/>VVe must also consider, that. Fluids of all Kinds contain a
          <lb/>great Quantity of Air.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Part then of the Operation of Vegetation seems to us
          <lb/>to he performed in the following <hi rend="u">mann</hi>er ; the Lobes of</p>
        <p>the Seed are distended with, and fitll of, the nutritious saponaceous
          <lb/>Juice of the Earth, which Juice has in it a great Quantity
          <lb/>of Air: This Air, being rarefied by the Heat of the Sun,
          <lb/>is perpetually endeavouring to ascend, and get above the Surface
          <lb/>of the Earth, that it may perspire through the Pores of
          <lb/>the Lobes, and mix with the Atmosphere, as we find in Fact
          <lb/>it does, when these Lobes become the seminal Leaves, and get
          <lb/>above the Surface of the Ground ; but the Pores of the Lobes
          <lb/>being stopp'd by the surrounding Earth, the Ain, which cannot
          <lb/>yet make its Escape, acting perpetually upon the Inside of the
          <lb/>Lobes, forces them to tend perpendicularly upwards, and with
          <lb/>them the Plume. . . ,.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If it should he said, that the Grains of Barley; in Steep in
          <lb/>order to be made into Malt, or that Acorns, Chesnuts, Pistachio-nuts,
          <lb/>or any other Seeds, when laid in a moist Place to
          <lb/>sprout, send the Radicle downwards, and the Plume upwards,
          <lb/>notwithstanding the Pores of the Lobes cannot in this Situation
          <lb/>be stopp'd by the surrounding Earth ; I answer. That even
          <lb/>suppofing the Pores of the Lobes not to be stopp’d at all, the
          <lb/>same End will yet be answer'd, and the Lobes, together with
          <lb/>the Plume, will be elevated perpendicularly, by the rarefied
          <lb/>Air perspiring through the Pores, and tending upwards.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But if we may suppose, that the perspiring Air carries along
          <lb/>with it a Portion of the nutritious Juice, in the Form of a
          <lb/>Vapour, imperceptible to the naked Eye, as such Vapours always
          <lb/>ascend, they must necessarily make the Lobes from
          <lb/>whence they perspire, endeavour to do so likewise, because
          <lb/>they must have this Tendency to rise, before they have quitted
          <lb/>the Vessels in winch they were contain’d, whilst circulating
          <lb/>in the Lobes.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Now, if this Reasoning, in regard to the Elevation of the
          <lb/>Plume, holds good, 'tis not necessary to mention the Reasons
          <lb/>why the Radicle shoots downwards, because the Radicle must
          <lb/>necessarily grow in a Direction contrary to that of the Plume.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Let us now pursue the Progress of the nutritious Juice, or
          <lb/>Sap, and endeavour to investigate the Method taken hy Nature
          <lb/>to conduct this Embryo to a perfect State.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We have observ'd above, that the Radicle and Plume receive
          <lb/>their first Nourishment from the Lobes. Now; when the
          <lb/>Radicle has fix'd itself in the Earth, and has put out Fibres
          <lb/>sufficient for the Support of the Plant, 'tis probable, that the
          <lb/>Order of Circulation is chang’d, and that the Lobes, now
          <lb/>about to become the seminal Leaves, receive, in their tum.
          <lb/>Nourishment from their Root, either by the same Vessels
          <lb/>which originally convey'd Nourishment to the Radicle, Or by
          <lb/>others, which last , is most probable.</p>
        <p><hi rend="sup">f</hi> These Lobes, now become seminal Leaves, and got above
          <lb/>Ground, are of great Use to the Plant-; for, if these are taken
          <lb/>away before the true-Leaves are expanded sufficiently to perform
          <lb/>their Office, the Plant immediately withers and dies.
          <lb/>The Office‘they perform I take to be this.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tn a known Maxim in Hydraulics, that when a Number
          <lb/>of Branches proceed from one large Pipe, or Canal, if one
          <lb/>of these Branches is open'd, a greater Quantity of the Fluid
          <lb/>circulating in these Pipes will flow to every Branch proceeding
          <lb/>from the-same Pipe. Now these seminal Leaves, once
          <lb/>got above Ground, are m a perpetual State of Perspiration,
          <lb/>when the Heat of the Atmosphere is sufficient to rarefy .the
          <lb/>Juices of the Plants enough sor that Purpose; or in an imbibing
          <lb/>State; when the Heat is not so great as to make them
          <lb/>perspire, insomuch that Plants generally perspire in the Daytime,
          <lb/>and imbibe the Ain, and its Contents, in the Night, at
          <lb/>the Leaves. : When therefore these seminal Leaves are in a
          <lb/>State of Perspiration, a greater Quantity of the nutritious
          <lb/>Juice is deriv’d not only to these seminal Leaves, hut also to
          <lb/>the leading Stein or Head of the Plant, which is nourish'd by
          <lb/>Vesseis proceeding from the same Trunk with those which
          <lb/>nourish the seminal Leaves. By means of this Perspiration,
          <lb/>there is a perpetual Supply of a nutritious Fluid drawn to the
          <lb/>ascending Branch os the Plant sor its Support and Increase,
          <lb/>which ceases, if the Perspiration of these seminal Leaves is
          <lb/>by any means stopp'd, or if the Leaves are taken away before
          <lb/>the true Leaves are expanded, and grown large enough to perform
          <lb/>their Office, and by perspiring in a due Quantity to draw
          <lb/>a sufficient Nourishment to the leading Stem, or Head. ..-</p>

          <lb/>of the true Leaves, is from thence communicated to the AirVessels
          <lb/>of the Trunk, winch, being distended therewith to the
          <lb/>very Root, the sinall Vesseis, which before convey'd the nutritious
          <lb/>Juice to the seminal Leaves, are compress’d and stopp’d
          <lb/>up ; the Consequence of which is, that the seminal Leaves must
          <lb/>perish. Here again we have an Instance of an exact Uniformity.
          <lb/>in animal and vegetable Productions ; and may observe, with
          <lb/>Wonder, the Analogy betwixt the one and the other.</p>
        <p rend="indent">A young Animal originally receives its Nourishment from a
          <lb/>Placenta or Cotyledon, by means of a Navel-string ; but as soon
          <lb/>aS the Animal is born, and is capable of taking in its Nourish-. </p>
        <pb n="43"/>
        <p>incht at the Mouth, there being no farther Occasion for the
          <lb/>Placenta or Cotyledon, the Navel-string rots, and the A<hi rend="u">nimal</hi>
          <lb/>is separated from them. Mean time the Ain, falling into the
          <lb/>Vessels of the Lungs, entirely alters the Circulation of the
          <lb/>Blood and Juices.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tis pretty much the same in Vegetables, where the Insant
          <lb/>Plant is originally nourish'd by Juices which it receives from the
          <lb/>Lobes, by means of Vessels analogous to a Navel-string; hut
          <lb/>as soon as the Mouths Of the Plant, that is, the Pores of the
          <lb/>Root, are sufficiently opened to provide for its own Support,
          <lb/>the Circulation in somewhat altered ; and the Root giving Nona
          <lb/>Iishment to the Lobes, they become the seminal Leaves, which
          <lb/>rot off as soon aS the Plant has no farther Occasion for them
          <lb/>Assistance.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Animals are kept alive by an alternate Inspiration and Ex-<hi rend="sup">-</hi>
          <lb/>piration of the Air, that is, by the Air's being taken into, and
          <lb/>foon after expell'd out of, the Lungs ; and if this Inspiration and
          <lb/>Expiration is prevented for but a Very little time, the Animal
          <lb/>dies. There is also something in the Air, which; in all Probability,
          <lb/>is communicated to, and mixes with,’ the Bloed of Ainmass,
          <lb/>entering the fine Pores of the Blood-vessels in the Lungs
          <lb/>during Inspiration. This I take to he the Acid floating in the
          <lb/>Air; and a fresh Supply of this is so necessary to Lise, that no
          <lb/>Animal can live long, is confin’d in a close Place where there is
          <lb/>no Communication with the external Air.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Something of the Very same Nature happens to Vegetables ;
          <lb/>they suspire or take in Air at the Leaves, during the Night,
          <lb/>and in moist Weather ; and in the Daystime, especially in the
          <lb/>Morning, when the Weather is warm, they expire, that is,
          <lb/>the Ah is- expell'd from the Plant, and carries along with it a
          <lb/>Part os the nutritious Juice or Sap, in the Form <hi>of an</hi> exceeding
          <lb/>fine Vapour, aS it does from the Lungs of Animais, where
          <lb/>it is Visible in frosty Weather. And this Acid of the Air, or
          <lb/>whatever is so necessary to . the Life of Animals, is not less so
          <lb/>to the Life of Vegetables; for all Plants wherever will quickly
          <lb/>die, if set in a close Place, or covered with any Vessel in such
          <lb/>a manner, as to be depriv'd of a free Intercourse with the external
          <lb/>Air.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Leaves then of Vegetables may justly he esteem’d their
          <lb/>Lungs, and are so necessary to their well-being, that if all the
          <lb/>leaves are pull'd off a Plant, it will neither inspire nor expire ;
          <lb/>and an immediate Stop is put to all Accretion or Growth, insomuch
          <lb/>that the Plant generally dies. ’ 'Tis upon, account of
          <lb/>this Perspiration of Plante at the Leaves, that when Trees are
          <lb/>transplanted, they cut off a great many of the Leaves and
          <lb/>Branches, that they may not perspire too much, and kill themfelves
          <lb/>before the Roots are sufficiently fix'd in the Ground, to
          <lb/>supply them with a due Quantity of Nourishment; and prudent.
          <lb/>Gardeners shade their Plants, when first transplanted, that the
          <lb/>Sun may not make their Perspiration too great, before the Roots
          <lb/>are capable os bringing a proportional Supply of Juices. But
          <lb/>this Inspiration and Expiration of Plants at the Leaves is only
          <lb/>necessary at that Season of the Year when .they increase or grow .7
          <lb/>and accordingly we find, that against the Winter the Leaves
          <lb/>drop off, when there is no farther Occasion for their Ministry,
          <lb/>from all but Ever-greens, which probably always, in some Degree,
          <lb/>inspire and expire.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We heve now conducted the Plant above the Surface of the
          <lb/>Earth : It remains, that we examine into some Circumstances
          <lb/>relating to its Accretion or Growth, and shew by what means
          <lb/>it is brought to Perfection.</p>
        <p rend="indent">What has heen said of the seminal Leaves drawing Nourishment,
          <lb/>holds good of all the true Leaves os a Plant; for they all
          <lb/>bring Nourishment to themselves, and the adjacent Parts, by the
          <lb/>Means, and for the Reasons already taken Notice of: And as
          <lb/>the rarefy'd Air and Vapour in the Leaves is perpetually tending
          <lb/>upwards, this still preserves the Perpendicularity of the Plant,
          <lb/>and keeps the Stem in an upright Direction, unless it is forced
          <lb/>to deviate from its Perpendicularity, by some intervening Accident.
          <lb/></p>
        <p rend="indent">There is another thing which may asso contribute something
          <lb/>towards the Perpendicularity of Plants, and that is the different
          <lb/>Density of the Ain at different Distances from the Earth. 'Tis
          <lb/>well known, that the Ain is heaviest at the Surfaces Of the
          <lb/>Earth ; and that it decreases in Gravity every Inch, to the
          <lb/>utmost Limits of the Atmosphere. Now, when a Vegetable is
          <lb/>once got above the Surface of the Earth, the Direction of its
          <lb/>Growth must be towards that Part where it meets the least
          <lb/>Resistance; and as the Air is loss dense above the Plant than
          <lb/>round about, it must meet with less Resistance upwards, and
          <lb/>consequently tend that Way.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I am sensible, that the Difference in the Air's Gravity at fuch
          <lb/>littie Distances from the Earth, is very small; but small as it
          <lb/>is, it may have a considerable Effect upon so tender a thing as a
          <lb/>young Plant.</p>
      </entryFree>
      <entryFree>
        <p rend="indent"><orth>AS</orth> the Body of the Plant is daily more and more distended by
          <lb/>the Heat of the Sun in all its Dimensions, the Fluids it contains
          <lb/>are yet more distended hy the said Cause, I say more, because
          <lb/>Fluids having a less Degree of Cohesion than Solids, their component
          <lb/>Parts more easily recede from each other, and therefore</p>
        <p>take up more Room: The Consequence of this is, that the conraining
          <lb/>Vefieis of the Plant must he press'd on all Sides by the
          <lb/>Contained Fluid, and grow larger; mean time the Ain contained
          <lb/>in the Air-vessels of the Plant in also rarefied and distended, so
          <lb/>as to keep constantiy of the same Density as the external Ain.
          <lb/>Thus we see the Plant is constantiy compress'd betwixt the internal
          <lb/>and external Ain; and as the Veffeis of the Plant are more
          <lb/>expanded by the Rarefaction of the internal Ain, the external
          <lb/>Air is also rarefied, and consequently, pressing less upon the Surface
          <lb/>of the Plans, gives it more Liberty to increase its Dimenfions
          <lb/>Outwards, and yield to the internal Pressure both of the
          <lb/>Sap, and internal Ain; but as the Heat os the Atmosphere is
          <lb/>seldom many Moments exactly the same, the Rarefaction and
          <lb/>Density both of the internal and external Ain must he perpetually
          <lb/>altering, as the Heat increases and decreases; insomuch
          <lb/>that the Force of the Air acting upon the Inside os the Plant,
          <lb/>and upon the Surface, is different almost every Moment; so
          <lb/>that by this Pressure, a Plant is acted upon much in the same
          <lb/>manner as a Potter, who is going to form a Vessel, would act
          <lb/>upon his Clay, pressing the Inside with one Hand, and the Outfide
          <lb/>with the other; ’ . <hi rend="sup">z</hi> ..</p>
        <p rend="indent">The reflecting Reader will readily observe, that something
          <lb/>shore than what we have already mention'd is necessary towards
          <lb/>Vegetation, otherwise the Plant would indeed be distended;
          <lb/>but then its Veffeis would grow much thinner, just in the same
          <lb/>manner as a Glass Vessel under the Hands of the Maker decreases
          <lb/>in Thickness; as the Surface is enlarged by the Air the Operator
          <lb/>forces within; or the Sap-vessels and Air-vessels of the Plant
          <lb/>would be like a Parcel of Bladders laid contiguous to each other,
          <lb/>some of them distended with Water, and others with Ain,
          <lb/>where the containing Vessels would decrease jn Thickness, as
          <lb/>they were expanded by their Contents : We are therefore to
          <lb/>explain how it comes to pass, that Plants increase in Solidity as
          <lb/>well as Dimensions.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Part of the Operation then seems to he performed by
          <lb/>the means of Cold, in the following manner ;</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Heat os the Sun in the Day-time having distended the
          <lb/>Sap in the Vessels, and made a Part of it perspire through the
          <lb/>Pores of the Leaves, in order to draw Nourishment to them- .
          <lb/>selves and the adjacent Parts, the Coldness of the Night immediately
          <lb/>succeeding, when Plants are not in a State of Perspirairon,
          <lb/>this Coldness contracts both the Solids and Fluids of the <hi rend="sup">;</hi>
          <lb/>Plant; for 'tis the Nature Of Cold to contract all Bodies whatever,
          <lb/>and reduce them into a less Space, which must he effected
          <lb/>by making the Particles of Matter, of which they are compos'd,
          <lb/>approach nearer each other ; and the Particles Of Matter are
          <lb/>known to attract each Other very strongly at small Distances,
          <lb/>and infinitely more when their Surfaces exactly touch each
          <lb/>other : Therefore that Part of the fluid Sap winch Is nearest the
          <lb/>solid Sides of the Veffeis, is, by the Action of Cold, which
          <lb/>contracts both the Solids and Fluids, forc'd into Contact with
          <lb/>the Solids, where it sticks fast by reason of the increas’d Altraction
          <lb/>5 and thus are the Salts and Earth, which werediflolV’d
          <lb/>in the Sap, applied to the Vessels, and reduced to a Spljd ; and .
          <lb/>in this the Salts and Earth are much assisted by the Oil and Water,
          <lb/>which, entering betwixt each Particle of Matter, fill up
          <lb/>the Vacant Spaces, and render the Cohesion stronger; just in
          <lb/>the fame manner aS two polish'd Pieces of Marble applied to
          <lb/>each other will adhere Very strongly when the Surfaces areuoiled ;
          <lb/>and- as Leather or Paper will stick closely to any Body, when
          <lb/>wet. ..... .. . . . ' - . .. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">When once these Particles of Matter have acquired such a
          <lb/>Degree of Cohesion, the Heat of the Sun, next Day, approaching
          <lb/>by gentie Degrees, is not capable Of dissolving this Union,
          <lb/>which however it would do, was it more sudden and intense ;
          <lb/>and indeed we find, that this Union is utterly dissolv'd by
          <lb/>Heat or Fine applied to Vegetables in4 certain Degree; for,
          <lb/>when Vegetables are burnt, the Oil and Water is dissipated or
          <lb/>destroy'd, whilst the Salts and Earth remain without any con-,
          <lb/>fiderable Cohesion.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But so sar is this gradual Heat from destroying this Cohesion
          <lb/>of. the Particles of Matter, that it increases it; and by drying
          <lb/>up the superfluous Moisture, helps to harden it, and renders it
          <lb/>more solid, just in the same manner as Bricks, before they are
          <lb/>committed to the Kiln to be burnt, are dried and hardened <hi>by
          <lb/>the Heat of the Sun</hi>,</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thus we see how necessary a Vicissitude of Heat and Cold
          <lb/>is to the Vegetable World ; for without it not a single Plant,
          <lb/>could grow upon the. Face of the Earth : Was the Atmosphere
          <lb/>to he always hot. Vegetables would beta a perpetual State of
          <lb/>Perspiration, so long as the Earth could afford a Supply of

          <lb/>affording Only a Conveyance to that Fluid which is forced thro’;
          <lb/>them by the Fire. AS a Confirmation of this, we may fre...
          <lb/>?uently observe in very hot Summers, that Plants set in a warm
          <lb/>lace, much exposed to the Sun, perspire themselves almost to
          <lb/>Death, and grow but Very little; whilst others, planted in the

        <p rend="indent">Many have been the Disputes amongst Naturalists .concerning
          <lb/>the Circulation of the Sap in Vegetables; some will have
          <lb/>it, that it rises in Vessels analogous to the Arteries in Animals,
          <lb/>and is again return'd towards the Root by other Vessels analogous
          <lb/>to the Veins; others again are of Opinion, that there is
          <lb/>uro such Retrogradation of the Sap ; and both Parties bring Experiments
          <lb/>to justify their different Sentiments. For my own
          <lb/>Part, I believe there are no peculiar Vessels in Plants destined,
          <lb/>like the Arteries and Veins in Animais, for the Flux and Reflux
          <lb/>of the .circulating Juices ; but that the Sap rises, and in some
          <lb/>measure again retires, by the same Vessels, as both the solid and
          <lb/>fluid Parts of the Plant are dilated by Heat, and contracted by
          <lb/>Cold. .et .</p>
        <p rend="indent">It may riot be amiss to make one more Observation concerning
          <lb/>the strict Analogy there is betwixt Animals and Vegetables.
          <lb/>It is well known so Anatomists, that the Bodies of Animais
          <lb/>abound with. Glands of different Sorts.; which are destin'd by
          <lb/>Nature to separate Various Kinds of Liquors from the Blood,
          <lb/>* necessary either for the Preservation of the Animal, or the Propagation
          <lb/>of the Species ; thus the Bile or. Gall is separated by
          <lb/>the Liver, arid the Saliva or Spittie by the Glands about the
          <lb/>Mouth and Throat. I don't in the least doubt, that there is a
          <lb/>Mechanismjike this in Plants Of all Sorts; and that Vegetables
          <lb/>are furnished with Glands in Vast Numbers dispersed all over
          <lb/>them, which separate different Liquors from the hap, according
          <lb/>to the’Exigencies of those Parts where they are plac'd ; and by
          <lb/>these Glands I apprehend the nutritious Juices os the Earth are
          <lb/>converted, if I may use that Expression, into the specific Juices
          <lb/>os the . Plant.; which Juices distinguish every Plant upon the
          <lb/>Face os the Earth from every' other Plant, as much as their'
          <lb/>Forms and Complexions,
          <lb/>; What we.have above call'd; aster Dr. <hi>Grew</hi>, the <hi>Parenchyma</hi>,
          <lb/>I take to consist of a great Number of Glands destin'd to
          <lb/>separate a peculiar Fluid from the Sap ; and I also take the Pith
          <lb/>to he a Congeries or Bundle of Glands, tied to each other";
          <lb/>or what she Anatomists call a conglomerate Gland ; and as the
          <lb/>Pith is in greater Quantity in proportion, and more juicy, in
          <lb/>young Plants, and the young Shoots of Trees, than in old
          <lb/>ones, I conclude, that it furnishes a Fluid absolutely necessary
          <lb/>to the Accretion or Growth of the Plant. Now, as the Buds
          <lb/>are form'd in, and proceed from, the Pith, if I may he allow'd
          <lb/>. a Conjecture, do not the Glands of the Pith separate a Liquor
          <lb/>necessary for the Formation and Support of the Bud ? And may
          <lb/>not the Apices, of Flowers be considered as Glands separating
          <lb/>the <hi>Farina foscundans</hi>, for the Impregnation of the Pistil or
          <lb/>Uterusss</p>
        <p rend="indent">I am far from entering into those romantic Notions and OprIsionS
          <lb/>of some late Writers, who dream that the first Plant of
          <lb/>every Species which grow upon the Face of the Earth, <hi>cone-</hi>
          <lb/>tam'd in it every individual Plant, with its Seeds, in Miniature,
          <lb/>which haXe. since been propagated from it; for it seems to be
          <lb/>more consistent with the general Order observ'd by Providence,
          <lb/>that one Plant- should, by a particular Mechanism, be render'd
          <lb/>capable of forming another of the same Species out <hi>of</hi> fuch Maserial?
          <lb/>as the juices of the Earth afforded, than that at the
          <lb/>Creation one Plant should be stuffed into another, and another
          <lb/>into that, and so on, <hi>ad infinitum</hi>, like a Nest os Boxes.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We proceed now to make some Observations on the Flowers :
          <lb/>The first thing then that occurs worthy Of Observation in
          <lb/>Flowers is,; that they perform the fame Office to the generative
          <lb/>Organs, as the Leaves do to Other Parts of Plants, that is,
          <lb/>draw Nourishment to them for their Support, by perspiring;
          <lb/>and that they do. actually.perspire, and in great Quantities, is
          <lb/>certain; because they transmit to Our Organs certain Effluvia,
          <lb/>winch affect us with that Sensation winch we call Smelling.
          <lb/>These Effluvia are a Portion of the <hi>Spiritus Factor</hi>, or prevailing
          <lb/>.Spirit; winch is exactly alike in no two Plants os different Sorts,
          <lb/>hut the same in every Branch of the same Family, allowing for the
          <lb/>Accidents os Soil and. Climate,, and is inimitable by Art. This
          <lb/><hi>Spiritus Rector</hi> resides in the essential Oils of Vegetables, and is
          <lb/>probably sensed by the finest and most Volatile Parts of these essential
          <lb/>Oiis, exalted by, and mixt with, the Particles of Light or
          <lb/>Heat, which are embodied with them, and reside therein in a
          <lb/>solid Form.; and this. I the rather believe, because the essential
          <lb/>Odin of Plants are of an alcaline Nature, especially those of the
          <lb/>aromatic Kind, which, growing in hot Climates, hevea greater
          <lb/>Proportion.of the Particles .of Fire in their Composition, in.stances
          <lb/>to our present Purpose are the Oiis of;Cloves, Sassafras,
          <lb/>and Caraway, which make a violent Effervescence, when mixt
          <lb/>with fuming Spirit of Nitre. Now, in many Instances, Tire</p>
        <p>renders Bodies it acts upon alcaline, or, however, dissipates or
          <lb/>neutralizes the Acids which they contain. Therefore, as
          <lb/>essential Oiis are of an alcaline Nature, I think it highly probable,
          <lb/>that they are. render'd fohy the Particles of Fine, which
          <lb/>enter their Composition. And when I consider the extreme:
          <lb/>Volatility of this <hi>Spiritus Factor</hi>, I <hi rend="u">am</hi> farther co<hi rend="u">nfi r</hi>m'd in the
          <lb/>Opinion, that the Particles of Light or Fine are a Parr of its
          <lb/>Composition.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Is we wanted an Instance to prove the Destruction of Acids
          <lb/>by Fire, we might find one in moil Kinds of Fruits, which are
          <lb/>originally acid ; but this Acid is by Degrees destroy’d, and the
          <lb/>Juices of the Fruit neutraliz'd, as it imbibes the Particles of
          <lb/>Fine, that is, as the Fruit ripens. . . .*</p>
        <p rend="indent">I have a few more Observations to make upon Flowers with
          <lb/>regard to their Colours, which, however Various and beautiful,
          <lb/>may easily be accounted for by the Action Os the Acid of the
          <lb/>Air so often mentioned, upon a Portion of the Oil, or, as the
          <lb/>Chymists call it. Sulphur of Plants, when exposed to the Ain
          <lb/>upon the Surfaces of the Petals or Flower-leaves ; and, indeed,
          <lb/>if we consider that the Varieties in Colours depend entirely upon,
          <lb/>the different Reflexions, Refractions, and Suffocations, the
          <lb/>Rays <hi>of</hi> Light undergo upon, the Surfaces of Bodies, 'tis not surprising
          <lb/>that so penetrating a thing as the Acid of the Air, acting
          <lb/>forcibly upon Sulphur,- which the Chymists, by.a Multitude of
          <lb/>Experiments, have prov’d to be the Parent of Colours, should
          <lb/>so far alter the Disposition and Texture of its Particles, aS to
          <lb/>produce those beautiful Colours which we observe in the Petals
          <lb/>of Flowers ; and aS the most minute Difference conceivable in
          <lb/>Sulphurs or Oiis will also make a Difference in the Action of
          <lb/>the Acid thereon, the Variegation, or the Variety of Colours in
          <lb/>the same Flower, may, from these Principles, he easily
          <lb/>accounted sor.</p>
        <p rend="indent">A great many Liquors, originally clear and limpid, will, by
          <lb/>being expos'd to. the Air, become red ; - and if 4 Bottie iS fill'd
          <lb/>half or three Parts full of these Liquors, the small Quantity of
          <lb/>Air contain’d in the Bottie, though closely stopp’d, <hi rend="u">shall</hi> have
          <lb/>this Effect upon them. That this is caused by the Air, is very
          <lb/>?lain ; because if another Bottie is fill’d quite full with the same
          <lb/>dquors, and guarded carefully .from the Ain, the Liquors will
          <lb/>retain their Limpidity. - .</p>
        <p rend="indent">And indeed nothing is more cominon than for Acids to change</p>
        <p rend="indent">the Colours of Bodies; thus Nitre, which contains an Acid,
          <lb/>and even the add Smoak of Wood, will make Flesh intensely
          <lb/>red.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Those, who are concerned in the Trade of Dying, observe,
          <lb/>that a cloudy, moist Air, very much interferes with the Vividness
          <lb/>and Beauty of their Colours; and, on the contrary, a
          <lb/>serene Sky exalts their Colours, and makes them more elegant.
          <lb/>Now, it is certain, that an Acid does not so much abound ina
          <lb/>moist, cloudy Air, aS in one which is serenei</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Colours os Flowers are also liable to the very same. Acctdent;
          <lb/><hi>for in</hi> cloudy, moist Weather, they are never so vivid
          <lb/>and exalted as when the Air is serene and dry. -. . „ .</p>
        <p rend="indent">So much has been said already upon the Seeds of Plants, and
          <lb/>their Generation, that 'tis unnecessary to repeat it in this Place :
          <lb/>I shall therefore proceed to the Decay of Vegetables.</p>
        <p rend="indent">An annual Plant, when it has once brought the Seed to Perfection,
          <lb/>has answer'd the End of "Providence; and now the
          <lb/>Vessels which bring Nourishment to the Leaves being fum'd up,
          <lb/>incrusted within-fide, and render’d impervious, that is, no
          <lb/>longer hollow, the Leaves can no more perspire,. but wither
          <lb/>and drop off; mean time the Vessels of the Root and Stem ,.
          <lb/>undergo the same Fate with those of the Leaves; insomuch
          <lb/>that the whole Plant dies, rots, and helps to supply the Earth
          <lb/>with a fresh Pabulum, or .Food for a succeeding Generation.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There is a large Class of Plants which are called perennial, of
          <lb/>which Sort are Trees that live for Ages; these, likenannual
          <lb/>Plants, lose their Leaves against Winter, and for the same Reason
          <lb/>; hut then the Sap-yeflels in the Root and Trunk continue
          <lb/>pervious or hollow, so that eVen in the Winter a sort Of Very
          <lb/>languid Circulation is maintain'd, much like that by winch Tortoises,
          <lb/>Snakes, and many Sorts of Insects, are kept alive during
          <lb/>Winter. These, at the Approach os Spring, when the Heat is
          <lb/>increas’d, and the Earth has been for many Months laying in st.
          <lb/>Stock of Pabulum, or Food,, for their Support, put out Leaves
          <lb/>afresh, perspire and grow, till at last the Sap-veffeis in .the.
          <lb/>Root and Trunk are obstructed, and become impervious by »
          <lb/>Degrees, insomuch that when the Circulation is entirely stopp'd
          <lb/>in any Part of it, the Air dissolves its Texture, and It grad<hi rend="u">ually</hi>
          <lb/>decays, dies, and rots.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As the Decay ofTrees begins in the Middle, .this .is a strong
          <lb/>Evidence, that the Air penetrates into their <hi rend="u">inm</hi>ost Recesses ;
          <lb/>for nothing can rot, unless expos'd to the Air. <hi>.And</hi> this Observation
          <lb/>helps to confirm what we have already laid down in
          <lb/>regard to the Air-Vessels of Plants. ῆ -. ...</p>
        <p rend="indent">I have purposely omitted obviating some Objections .which
          <lb/>may be made against many things I have advanc'd, (and winch
          <lb/>I think may easily be defended) for sear os heing too prolix; and
          <lb/>for the same Reason I have not .drawn all the Corollaries thet
          <lb/>the Subject would have admitted of. As I hope 1 have led the </p>

        <p rend="indent">Render in a just way ofThinking upon these Subjects, his own

          <lb/>Truths, which I have either omitted, or, perhaps, not observ’d;
          <lb/>and the more be pries into the Mysteries of Nature, -the more
          <lb/>will he adore the Power and Goodnefs of the Supreme Being,
          <lb/>. whe created all Things in the Beginning, .and <hi rend="u">still</hi> continues to
          <lb/>protect them by a Series of Miracles not lefs wonderful than
          <lb/>that of their first Creation ; otherwise the whole Frame of the
          <lb/>Universe would, in an instant, he utterly dissolv’d, and all
          <lb/>things degenerate into their original Chaos.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There is one Experiment, which should he taken Notice of
          <lb/>hesore we dismiss the Subjecti of Vegetation, which is this: Immerse
          <lb/>the Ends of a Parcel of cylindrical Glass Tubes, open at
          <lb/>both Ends, in Water, and the Water will rise in thefe Tubes
          <lb/>above the Surface of the rest of the Water, hut always highest
          <lb/>in the least Τube: Now, as ’tis very likely something of the
          <lb/>same Nature happens in the Sap-vessels os Plants,- mis may he
          <lb/>a great Help to Vegetation, and contribute much to the Rising
          <lb/>of the Sap.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I shall conclude the Article of Botany with some Account
          <lb/>of the principal Authors upon rhe Subjeci, and to these I shall

          <lb/>eat a great Number os raw Garden Parsnips in the Morning,
          <lb/>without the least injury.</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>Galen</hi> makes the immediate Cause to he, first, a Vicious and
          <lb/>acid Humour stimulating the Stomach ; and, secondly, a want
          <lb/>of Nourishment from too great a Digestion.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Vicious Humours lodged in the Stomach excite an immoderate
          <lb/>Hunger, because by their excessive Coldness, Acidity,
          <lb/>and Austerity, they cause a Constriction, Corrugation, and

        <p rend="indent">The different Causes os this Distemper are distinguishable

          <lb/>consequent to it. , Acid Evacuations and Vomitings, crude
          <lb/>Stools, and want Of Thirst, are Signs of an Acid abounding
          <lb/>in the Stomach. In Defect of Nutrition, the Patients are
          <lb/>emaciated ; and lastly, the Signs Of Worms, are to -he taken
          <lb/>from their proper Symptoms.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As to the Prognostics of this Disorder, is it depends wholly
          <lb/>'on external Causes, there is no Danger, provided these are
          <lb/>speedily remov’d ; and what proceeds from Worms carries but
          <lb/>littie Danger in it, because their Effects cease as soon as they
          <lb/>are destroy'd. In Pregnancy, where an inordinate- Appetite
          <lb/>is frequent, there is no Danger to be apprehended from it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But the Distemper is Very dangerous when followed by large
          <lb/>Evacuations or Colliquations of the Body; and especially,
          <lb/>when after receiving Food, while the Stomach is yet full, the
          <lb/>Patientis seized with sainting Fits; for when those Things,
          <lb/>which ought -to give most Relief, prove of none or ill
          <lb/>Effect, it is a Sign of a great Disorder in the Tone Of the Stomach.

        <p rend="indent">So also the canine Appetite, when the Vomiting Or Flux
          <lb/>is obstinate, is not void of Danger; for it commonly degenerates
          <lb/>into a Cachexy, Dropsy, Lientery, Atrophy, and
          <lb/>other fatal Distempers. . .</p>
        <p rend="indent">For the therapeutic Part,. fince the <hi>Fames canina</hi> generally
          <lb/>takes its Rise from redundant Humours inherent arid lodging

          <lb/>the entire superior Extremities, and descrihe particularly
          <lb/>the Bones, Cartilages, and Ligaments, helonging to these.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Os Humeri, or Bone of the Arm, is heth longer and
          <lb/>thicker than any other Bono of the upper Extremity. It is
          <lb/>situated under the Acromium, along the lateral Part of the
          <lb/>Thorax, from which, however, it may be remov'd to a considerable
          <lb/>Distance in all Directions. Its Figure is irregularly
          <lb/>cylindrical, and it is thick at one End, and broad at the other.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is divided into the Body and two Extremities, - or into an
          <lb/>upper, middle, and lower Part. . -</p>
        <p rend="indent">The upper Part is generally call'd the Head of the Os Humeri,
          <lb/>and the Part immediately below that, is call'd the Neck. _</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the Head, we consider a Half-globe Obliquely inclined,
          <lb/>crusted over with a smooth Cartilage ; two Tuberosities, one
          <lb/>large, terminating upward in a Point, OVer-against the Halfglohe
          <lb/>; the other small, placed laterally hetween the large one
          <lb/>and the Hals-globe: A Chanel or Groove between the two
          <lb/>Tuberosities ; four muscular Impressions, three of which are,
          <lb/>on the large Tuberosity; one in the Apex, one on the Side opposite
          <lb/>to the Grove, and the third lower down on the same .
          <lb/>Side, Over-against rhe small Tuberosity upon which the fourth
          <lb/>is found. Of these, sour Impressions, that on the small Tuberosity,
          <lb/>and the second of the other three; are the largest.
          <lb/>All these Parts of the Head of the Os Humeri, are one Epiphysis
          <lb/>in Children, of which very plain Marks remain sometimes .
          <lb/>in an advanc’d Age.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Chanel, or Groove, between the two Tuberosities, is Continu'd
          <lb/>downwards, in an oblique Direction, thro' one Quarter
          <lb/>of the Length of the Bone; and there becoming rough, it
          <lb/>. forms a muscular impression, not always equally sensible. The
          <lb/>Edges of this Chanel are two Ridges, or prominent Lines,
          <lb/>continu'd down, as it were, from the two Tuberosities. That:
          <lb/>from the great Tuberosity is the most considerable, and is con- ,
          <lb/>tinu'd down to the Middle of the Pone, where it is lost in along,
          <lb/>broad, rais'd muscular impression,, more or less rough.
          <lb/>The other, which comes from the small Tuherosity, is less/
          <lb/>prominent, and shorter. At the Side of this Ridge, toward,
          <lb/>the lower Part, are two other narrow, longitudinal, and superficial
          <lb/>muscular Marks, one above the other, the lower Extremity
          <lb/>of the first reaching down on the fore Side of the upper
          <lb/>Extremity of the second.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The middle Part, or Body of the Os Humeri, comes nearer
          <lb/>to a cylindrical Figure than the Extremities. It is a little rais'd
          <lb/>at the rough Eminence, or impression, already mention’d. On
          <lb/>each Side of this Eminence is another muscular Impression,-which
          <lb/>uniting immediately below it, it appears to be inclos'd
          <lb/>hetween them as between the two Prongs of a Fork. On that
          <lb/>Side which answers to the Middle of the Half-globe, we see
          <lb/>likewise a longitudinal muscular Mark; and about the Middle
          <lb/>Of that Side which is eVen with the great Tuberosity, there is
          <lb/>an oblique hollow Turning, of a considerable Length and
          <lb/>Breadth, which, running down by the Side of the fork'd Impression,
          <lb/>makes this Part of the Bone appear contorted.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The lower Extremity of the OS Humeri is triangular from
          <lb/>' its Very Beginning, and from thence grows Very broad and flat,
          <lb/>heing hent a littie near the End, towards thet Side which answers
          <lb/>to the small Tuberosity in the upper Extremity. It is divided
          <lb/>into three Sides, two anterior, and one posterior, which
          <lb/>is the broadest ; and into three Angles, One anterior, and two
          <lb/>lateral. - - -</p>
        <p rend="indent">At the End of this broad Extremity are two Tuberosities; one
          <lb/>- short and prominent, answering directly to the Middle of the
          <lb/>Half-globe ; the other oblongs rough, and resembling a Crista,
          <lb/>which answers to the Apex of the great Tuberosity of the
          <lb/>Head. The short Tuberosity is call'd the internal Condyle,
          <lb/>the other the external Condyle. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Between these two Condyles, on the Very lowest Part of the. ,
          <lb/>concave Side of this Extremity, are two articular Eminences ;
          <lb/>one double, like a Pully, next the short Condyle; the other
          <lb/>rounded, like a finall Head, next the long Condyle. The
          <lb/>Pully has a great and small Edge, with a Depression between
          <lb/>them. The small Edge is dost in the round Eminence, or
          <lb/>Head ; the great one is gradually widen'd, and ends in a sharp
          <lb/>Circumference. This Pully is situated obliquely ; for, on the
          <lb/>Concave Side, it approaches toward the short Condyle, and,
          <lb/>on the other, it is turn'd from it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Three Foffuhe are likewise observable in this lower Part of
          <lb/>the Bone; two anterior, one immediately above the Pully, the
          <lb/>Other above the small Head; and one posterior, which is very
          <lb/>large, and situated likewise immediately above the Pully. in
          <lb/>Children, the Pully, the small Head, and she short Condyle,
          <lb/>are Epiphyses.. </p>

        <p rend="indent">The outer substance of this Bone is compact, especially in
          <lb/>the middle Pars, within which there is a large tubular Cavity,

          <lb/>remain for a long time epiphyses in some Subjects.</p>
        <p>It is connected with the Pully of the OS Humeri, by an arse
          <lb/>gular Ginglymus ; with the two Extremities of the Radius, by

        <p rend="indent">The Radius is nearly of the Tame'Length with the Ulnas
          <lb/>bigger at one End than at the other, irregularly triangular, a
          <lb/>littie bent, and situated along the Side os the Ulna. Its Name
          <lb/>is taken from the Resemblance it bears to tire Spoke of aWheel.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We are to consider in the Bone two Extremities, and 4
          <lb/>middle Portion. One Extremity is small, and like a kind of
          <lb/>Head set upon a Neck ; the other is large, resembling a Pedestal
          <lb/>or Basis; and therefore it might he divided into a Head,
          <lb/>Body, and Basis.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Head, or fmall Extremity of the Radius, is very short
          <lb/>or low, the Top of it is concave, and the Circumference cylindrical;
          <lb/>and both the Glenoide Cavity and the Circumference
          <lb/>are cover'd with the fame smooth shining cartdaginous Crust ;
          <lb/>and about one Quarter of the Circumference is broader than the'
          <lb/>rest. The Neck is small, and its Situation a little oblique. It
          <lb/>ends by a lateral Tuberosity, which lies directly under the broad
          <lb/>Part of the Head, being rough in the Middle and on one Side,
          <lb/>and smooth and superficially cartilaginous on the other.</p>
        <p>The Basis, or great Extremity of the Radius, .is much
          <lb/>broader than it is thick, and has two broad Sides, and one narrow.
          <lb/>One of the broad Sides is a littie hollow, and pretty eyen ;
          <lb/>the other is unequally convex, and divided by longitudinal
          <lb/>Eminences, or bony Lines, into three or four longitudinal
          <lb/>Chanels, much more distinct in fresh Bones than in the Sceleton.
          <lb/>‘ The narrow Side is concave lengthwife, and hetween its
          <lb/>Edges,.and those of the two broad Sides, two’Angles are form'd,
          <lb/>by which the three Sides are distinguish'd ; and, opposite to it,
          <lb/>the broad Sides form a common Edge, and a third Angle. This
          <lb/>narrow Side ends in a semilunar Cavity, border'd with a smooth
          <lb/>Cartilage, and lying almost in the fame Direction with the Tuberosity.
          <lb/>The broad Sides end at their common Angle, by an
          <lb/>ohttsse Point or Production, which has been call'd the Styloide
          <lb/>Apophysis of the Radius, and is really a Continuation of
          <lb/>one of the bony Lines.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The whole Basis ends in an oblung, triangular, Glenoide
          <lb/>Cavity, the Cartilage of which is continue over the hollow
          <lb/>Edge of the narrow Side. This is an articular Cavity, resembling
          <lb/>an Arch, and ending on one Side at the Styloide Apophyfis,
          <lb/>and hollow’d on the other, by the Cavity of the narrow
          <lb/>Side. It appears divided into two Portions by a small transversi:
          <lb/>Line, and in the natural State the hollow’d Side is lengthen'd out
          <lb/>by a cartilaginouS Production, the Description of which helonge

        <p rend="indent">The Hand is generally represented in Sceletons and Figures,
          <lb/>as lying in the same Plane, and in the same longitudinal Direction
          <lb/>with the Bones of the fore Arm. This gives a Very false
          <lb/>Idea of its trueSituation, which, with respect to the fore Arm,

          <lb/>the sore Armand, hesides, the fourth Bone of the Metacarpus
          <lb/>is inclined.towards the Ulna1 in particular. In a Word,

          <lb/>the fore Arm ; and the Thickness of the Hand, at the same
          <lb/>time, with tho Thickness of the fore Arm. 1 mean here that
          <lb/>Part of the sore <hi>Arm</hi> which is next the Hand.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This as owing to the Structure and SituationOf the Bones of
          <lb/>the Carpus, and to their Connexion with those of the fore Arm.
          <lb/>First, the two Rows <hi>Of</hi> these Bones, make a sort, of transverse
          <lb/>Fold onrthejconVex Side of the Carpus ; and the articular Brachial
          <lb/>Sides of the.two first Bones of the first Row. are turn'da
          <lb/>littie toward the same convex Side of the Carpus; which obliges
          <lb/>the whole Hand to he a litefe hent back in he natural Situation.
          <lb/>Secondly, the Edge of these Bones next the Ulna is much shorter
          <lb/>than .that next the Radius, which makes the Cubital Edge of the
          <lb/>whole Hand incline to that Side,</p>
        <p rend="indent">By not Considering this, a. large Void Space is commonly left
          <lb/>In Sceletons, between the Extremity of the Uina and the Oa
          <lb/>Cuneiforme Of the Carpus. It ought likewife to he observed,
          <lb/>that the edgeof the Metacarpus next theTJina is shorter than

        <p>In this, oblique and natural Situation oftheHand, the Fin^era
          <lb/>being extended, anda. little. separated, the Extremity of</p>
        <p>the fore Finger will he found to answer to the Interstice hetween
          <lb/>the Bones of the sore Arm; and if in this Situation we
          <lb/>make alternately the Motions of Pronation and Supination, the
          <lb/>Extremity Of the fore Finger will he found to he in some mcasore
          <lb/>the common Centre of these Motions.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Disposition of all the Bones of the Hand is moreover
          <lb/>Very well Contrived, to give it several kinds of Attitudes ; sor
          <lb/>hy means thereof it may he lengthen'd, flatted, shorten’d, and
          <lb/>contracted. The Hand is lengthen'd or widen’d, and flatted,
          <lb/>by extending all the Fingers,, .and turning back the Thumb,
          <lb/>winch is what is called extending or opening the Hand. It is
          <lb/>shorten'd by bending all the Fingers, whether in what is <hi rend="u">call</hi>'d
          <lb/>closing the Fist, or in grasping any thing ; and Io thin the Situation
          <lb/>of the Thumb, and the Oblique Disposition of the Bones
          <lb/>of the Metacarpus and Fingers, contribute in a particular manner.
          <lb/>And as in this Case the Thumb counterbalances all the
          <lb/>other Fingers, the Articulation of the first <hi rend="u">Phalan</hi>x thereof with
          <lb/>the <hi>Os Trapezium appears</hi> to he render'd more firm and steady,
          <lb/>by partaking a littie of the Nature of a Ginglymus, without
          <lb/>hindering its other Motions. Lastly, tho Hand is contracted,
          <lb/>and made into a fort of Gutter or Furrow, by the Adduction
          <lb/>Of the Thumb, and the assy Motion of the fourth Metacarpal
          <lb/>Bone; and if at the same time we hend the Fingers, and press
          <lb/>them close together, we heth shorten and contract the Hand ;
          <lb/>and thereby form a Hollow, which is called <hi>Diogenes’s</hi> Cup. ...</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the Fingers we ought likewise to remark, that though the

          <lb/>Phalanges of the other Fingers, he moveable in many Directions,
          <lb/>and framed nearly in the same manner as that of the Os Humeri
          <lb/>with the Scapula;«yet these Phalanges cannot he moved round
          <lb/>their Axes. Tins is not owing to their Conformation, but to
          <lb/>the want of proper Muscles. The same thing cannot he said of
          <lb/>the first Phalanx of the Thumb; because, though it had proper
          <lb/>Muscles, yet the kind of Half-ginglymus, by which it is articulated,
          <lb/>would not allow of such a Motion.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Thumb is situated differently from the other Fingers,
          <lb/>The Fingers, heth with respect to their Sides and Edges, have,
          <lb/>in their natural Situation, nearly the fame Direction with the

        <p rend="indent">The Carpus is the Basis and Centre of all the Motions of the
          <lb/>Hand, except that of Rotation. By means thereof, we can
          <lb/>bend the Hand in all Directions, but with more Ease toward the
          <lb/>Sides and Edges, than any other Way. The four Bones of the
          <lb/>second Row may have a small Degree of Motion on the first,
          <lb/>fuch as a Ginglymus can allow of.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Radius is in a manner the Handle of the Hand; and it
          <lb/>is chiefly by means thereof, that we can move the Hand reciprocally
          <lb/>as on the Axis, turning either Edge of it toward- the
          <lb/>Body. This Motion or Attitude is term'd Pronation; and
          <lb/>when the Cubital, or small Edge, is toward the Body, it is
          <lb/>term'd Supination. In the natural and most ordinary Situation
          <lb/>of the Hand, the Palm is turn'd toward the Body, and not the
          <lb/>Edges. .<space type="tab"> </space>-<space type="tab"> </space><space type="tab"> </space> ν ’</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Disposition of the Hand determines the trueSituation
          <lb/>of the Radius, which is not on one Side of the Ulna in a parallel
          <lb/>Direction, as the Figures and Sceletons commonly represent
          <lb/>it; but the Radius crofles the Ulna obliquely in such a
          <lb/>manner, as that the Styloide Apophyses in heth Bones are
          <lb/>directly over-against each other. This is its true natural Situation.
          <lb/>The Radius, heing bent, may he still farther cross’d over
          <lb/>the Ulna, than in its natural Situation ; and this happens in
          <lb/>Pronation, but in Supination it isparallel to the other Bone.. '</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Ulna supports the Handle of the Hand, without being
          <lb/>itself articulated with the Hand. Two lateral <hi>Ginglymi</hi>, and
          <lb/>Very strong Ligaments, connect the Radius closely with it, <hi>set</hi>
          <lb/>that in the most Violent Motions these two BoneS cannot be
          <lb/>separated. When we push or press any thing with the Hand,
          <lb/>the whole Force is sustain'd by the Radius, the Basis of which
          <lb/>supports the Wrist, and its concave Head is strongly pressed
          <lb/>against the small inferior Head of the Os Humeri. The oblique
          <lb/>Direction of the Pally of the Ulna is the Reason, that, in
          <lb/>hending the fore Arm upward, the Extremity of that Bone is
          <lb/>naturally turn’d Toward the Thorax, and shot without Difficulty
          <lb/>toward the Articulation Of the Scapula. -<space type="tab"> </space><space type="tab"> </space>i . - - - .. .</p>

        <p rend="indent">In all this Course the Capsula, is. closely fixed in the Bone,
          <lb/>except in' the small Space lest, between the two Tuberosities,
          <lb/>that is, at the Channel orSinus, where it forms a Production

          <lb/>membranous Tube is the Vagina ’ of the inter-articular Tendon

        <p rend="indent">The true Ligament of this Joint appears to be composed os
          <lb/>two Ligaments closely united together; one-a Capsular Ligament,
          <lb/>which surrounds the whole Articulation ; and the other,
          <lb/>fram'd by several true Ligaments which run over, and closely
          <lb/>adhere to the former in disterent Places.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thus the Capsula, or mucilaginous Bag of this Articulation,
          <lb/>is in part strongly united to four flat Tendons inserted in the
          <lb/>two Tuberosities ssand in part covered by-true ligamentary
          <lb/>Bands, which,-between the sour Tendons, and-on both Sides
          <lb/>of the first and last, form a considerable Thickness. The rest
          <lb/>of the Space between the first or superior Plane of the great
          <lb/>Tuberosity and the small Tuberosity is so little provided with
          <lb/>ligamentary Fibres, that it has been' believed to be altogether
          <lb/>without them ; and Anatomists have satissy’d themselves with
          <lb/>telling us, that in these Places the orbicular Ligament is very
          <lb/>rough on the Outside, but fifining and smooth on the Inside.</p>
        <p rend="indent">On the Body of the Os Humeri there are two particular Ligaments,
          <lb/>which I term'intermuscular, or-lateral. They are
          <lb/>long, flat, thin, strong, and narrow, fixed on one Edge along
          <lb/>the two lower Thirds of the Pone, and reselling to both Con,
          <lb/>dyies. They are braced pretty tight, and are very narrow at
          <lb/>the upper Part, but broader toward the Condyles.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The lower Extremity of the Os Humeri is joined to the
          <lb/>Bones of the fore Arm by two Fasciculi <hi>os</hi> Ligamentary Fibres,
          <lb/>one fixed to the internal Condyle, the other to the external.
          <lb/>Each Fasciculus is composed of Fibres closely joined together at
          <lb/>the Condyle, and afterwards parting in distinct Bands like a
          <lb/>Goose's Foot.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Capsular Ligament is fixed to the Condyles, and there
          <lb/>covers them ; - and afterwards it is fixed round both Sides of
          <lb/>this lower Extremity above the Foffuhe. Its Insertion in these
          <lb/>Sides is Archwise ; so that it is there at a much greater Distance
          <lb/>from the Articulation, than at the Condyles. FheFoffuhe are
          <lb/>Ilightly varnish'd over with a cartilaginous Substance.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Capsula appears to be strengthen'd by a Ligamentary
          <lb/>Web, the Fibres whereof cross each other in different Directions
          <lb/>; but we must not take <hi>for Ligamentary</hi> Filaments
          <lb/>some tendinous Fibres os Muscles, to which the Capsula adheres
          <lb/>Very closely. It appears larger and looser when the Muscles'
          <lb/>are separated from it, than in its natural State, when closely
          <lb/>united to the Muscles. ...</p>
        <p rend="indent">The two Sigmoide Cavities in the upper Extremity of the
          <lb/>. Ulna are covered by a Cartilage common to both, which is a
          <lb/>' littie interrupted about the Middle of the Edges os the Cavities
          <lb/>by the transverse Notches mentioned before. ’This cartilaginous
          <lb/>Crust seems to he thicker at the Edges, than in the
          <lb/>Middle., .</p>
        <p rend="indent">The inferior Extremity, or small Head of the Ulna, is
          <lb/>crusted over by a Cartilage round its cylindrical Border, in the
          <lb/>Notch near the Styloide Apophysis ; and for some Space on the
          <lb/>Apophysis itself.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Cartilage which covers the Head of the Radius is likewise
          <lb/>stretched over the cylindrical Border thereof; and a lateral
          <lb/>Portion of the muscular Tuberosity immediately below the
          <lb/>Neck is also covered with a thin shining Cartilage.</p>
        <p rend="indent">All the concave Side of the Basis of the Radius is cartilaginous,
          <lb/>and often divided by a small cartilaginous prominent Line. The</p>
        <p>lateral Notch of the Basis is likewife covered by a Continuation
          <lb/>of the same Cartilage. -</p>
        <p>The lateral Hals-grooves or Channels of the Basis of this
          <lb/>Pone appear likewise to be crusted over with a rarrn<hi rend="u">aoin</hi>nus
          <lb/>-Matter ; but this I rather take to be Portions os the <hi rend="u">annular</hi>
          <lb/>Ligaments.</p>
        <p>Ar the Basis of the Radius there is likewise a particular additional.
          <lb/>Cartilage,. or triangular Production, longer than it is
          <lb/>broad. Very thin, and rather flat than concave on both its smooth
          <lb/>Tides. It is fixed by its Basis, or shortest Side, t0 the lateral
          <lb/>Sigmoide Notch -of tho Basis os the Radius, in such a <hi rend="u">man</hi>n<hi rend="u">e</hi>r
          <lb/>as that one Side os ir is on a Level with the largo cartilaginous
          <lb/>Surface os the Basis of the Bone, and its Apex directly opposite
          <lb/>:to the Styloide Apophysis. The other Side touches the star ExIreinity
          <lb/>of the small Hoad os the Uina, but is not fixed to it.
          <lb/>..' Thin Cartilage may be term’d the interarticular Cartilage of
          <lb/>the Joint os the Wrist. It is tied to the Radius by very short
          <lb/>Ligaments ; and Aiding on tho small Head of the Ulna, it fol-:
          <lb/>lows all the Motions os the Radius. It is therefore a sort of
          <lb/>articular Production of the lower Side of tho Basis of the Radius,
          <lb/>and silis in the natural State the void Space, which, in the.SeeIeton,
          <lb/>appears between the End of the Ulna, and the neighbouring
          <lb/>Bone of the Carpus.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Some of the Ligaments of the Bones of the fore Arm are
          <lb/>common to them with the Os Humeri; some common to
          <lb/>them with the Bones of the Hand ; and some are propers
          <lb/>These last are two in Number ; one call’d the interosseous Ligament
          <lb/>os the sore Arm ; and one which may be termed the
          <lb/>coronary Ligament of the Radius. To these may be added the
          <lb/>annular Ligaments, which only serve sor the Passage os Tendons,
          <lb/>and other Ligamentary Expansions, -which may he <hi rend="u">call</hi>ed muscular
          <lb/>Ligaments.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The interosseous Ligament os the sore Arm is very like that
          <lb/>of the Leg. It is fixed by one Edge along the sharp Angle of
          <lb/>ths Ulna, and by tho other along that of the Radius. It is
          <lb/>principally made up of two very strong Planes of Fibres, which
          <lb/>cross each other at oblique Angles, and leave HoleS.at different
          <lb/>Distances for the Passage of the Blood-vessels.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Ligament ties the two Bones closely together ; and the
          <lb/>Two Planes serve sor the Insertion os several Muscles. In the
          <lb/>Supination os the Hand it is Very tightiy braced ; bur in Pronation
          <lb/>it is folded a little Lengthwise.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Coronary Ligament os the Radius is a fort of Ligamentary
          <lb/>Hoop surrounding the circular Circumference of the
          <lb/>Head of that Bone, reaching from one Side of the small lateral
          <lb/>sigmoide or transverse Cavity os the Ulna to the other, in an
          <lb/>Arch, which is about three quarters os a Circle. It is very
          <lb/>strong, and comes near the Solidity os a Cartilages The Side
          <lb/>next the Radius is very smooth ; and though it connects that
          <lb/>Bone Very closely to the Ulna, yet it leaves it room enough to
          <lb/>turn in the Motions of Pronation and Supination.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Capsular Ligament os the Joint os the Elbow runs
          <lb/>down from its Insertion in the Os Humeri, and is fixed hi the
          <lb/>Olecranuni round the Edge os the great Sigmoide Cavity, ineluding
          <lb/>both the Apex of the Olecranum, and of the Coronoide
          <lb/>Apophysis. It likewise runs over the Head of the Radius,
          <lb/>and is fixed to the Coronary Ligament quite round. Thus it completely
          <lb/>surrounds the Articulation of these three Bones, and serves
          <lb/>to contain the mucilaginous Liquor furnished by the Glands, and
          <lb/>fatty Substance, both which are found in great Quantities near
          <lb/>the Extremity of the Bone which forms the Elbow.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The true common Ligaments by which the Os Humeri is
          <lb/>connected to the Bones of the fore Arm, call’d lateral Ligaments,
          <lb/>are the two Fasciculi before-mentioned, which, after being
          <lb/>inserted in the Condyles of the Os Humeri, are expanded
          <lb/>like a Goose's Foot. That which is fixed in the inner Condyle ..
          <lb/>may be call'd Brach io-cubitale, and the other Brachio-radialei</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Brachio-cubital Ligament running down over the Capsula,
          <lb/>to which it closely adheres, below the great Edge os the
          <lb/>Trochlea os the Os Humeri, is inserted like Radii (os which
          <lb/>its other Extremity fixed in the Condyle is the Centre) on the
          <lb/>Side of the great Sigmoide Cavity of the Ulna. It is covered
          <lb/>on the Outside by several Tendons which adhere closely to it,
          <lb/>and seem to strengthen it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Brachio-radial Ligament is disposed much after the same
          <lb/>manner, but is os a greater extent. It is expanded from the
          <lb/>external Condyle os the Os Humeri, as from a Centre ; and is .
          <lb/>inserted round the Coronary Ligament, and from thence all the
          <lb/>Way down to the Neck of the Radius ; and also in the neighbouring
          <lb/>Parts of the Ulna. Through all this Passage it covers
          <lb/>the Capsular Ligament, and is covered by several Tendons adhering
          <lb/>closely to both.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Of the Ligaments by which these Bones are connected to
          <lb/>those of the Hand, one is like a roundish Cord fixed in the
          <lb/>Styloide Apophysis of the Ulna, and from thence passes directly
          <lb/>over the OS Cuneiforme os the Carpus,- in which, and in other
          <lb/>Bones, it is inserted in a peculiar manner. Another pretty
          <lb/>broad Ligament is fixed in the Point os the Radius ; and by its
          <lb/>other Extremity, in the Bones os the Carpus. </p>
        <pb n="57"/>
        <p rend="indent">Prom this Styloide Ligament of the Radius, along each Edge
          <lb/>of the Basis of that Bone, are Ranks of Ligamentary Fibres
          <lb/>lying much in the fame Direction with the Ligament itself,
          <lb/>and continued all the Way to the Styloide Ligament of the Ulna
          <lb/>; those nearest the Ulna'inclose the interarticular Cartilage
          <lb/>of the Basis of the Radius, and near the Styloide Ligament of
          <lb/>the Ulna there is a particular Fasciculus inserted in the Point
          <lb/>' of that Cartilage.</p>
        <p rend="indent">All these Ligaments surround and cover the Capsular <hi>Lsigdur</hi>
          <lb/>ment so closely, that they can hardly he distinguished from it.
          <lb/>The Capsula is likewise in part cover'd by a Portion of a
          <lb/>great oblique Ligament, which heing by a Very broad Insertion
          <lb/>fixed in the large extremity of the Radius, about two Fingers
          <lb/>Breadth above the Styloide Apex, afterwards crosses obliquely,
          <lb/>partly over the convex Side of the <hi>Basis Radii</hi>, and
          <lb/>partly over that of the Carpus; and then turning towards the
          <lb/>Os Orbiculare, is inserted therein. It is called the external
          <lb/>transverse Ligament of the Carpus; and may likewise be
          <lb/>named the great oblique Ligament of the Wrist.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There are several small annular Ligaments placed at different
          <lb/>Distances on the convex Side of the <hi>Basis Radii</hi>, from
          <lb/>its Styloide Apex to its Articulation with the Extremity of the
          <lb/>Ulna. They are at least six in Number, some of them being
          <lb/>often double or triple. '</p>
        <p rend="indent">The first is fixed in the Ssploide Apex; the second in the

          <lb/>the fifth, in the Corner of the semilunar Notch of the Basis,
          <lb/>at its Articulation with the Ulna ; and the sixth, in the
          <lb/>Extremity of the Ulna, near the Styloide Apophysis.</p>
        <p rend="indent">These particular Ligaments are almost wholly covered by
          <lb/>‘the great oblique Ligament; and are fixed as strongly in it on
          <lb/>one Side, as they are in the Bones on the other. They are
          <lb/>all very strong, and their concave Sides, serving sor <hi>Prana</hi> to
          <lb/>the Tendons of several Muscles that pass over them, are very
          <lb/>smooth, and accompanied with thin mucilaginous <hi>Fagina</hi>. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">To these we may add the Ligamentary Expansions, with
          <lb/>which several Muscles are Cover'd, and separated from each
          <lb/>other, as by so many distinct <hi>Septa</hi> ; which are all Very thick
          <lb/>and strong, where they are inserted in the Bones. One kind
          <lb/>of them may be term'd Ligamentary Bands, or muscular <hi>Vaginae</hi>,
          <lb/>the other Ligamentary <hi>Septa</hi>, Or intermuscular Ligaments.</p>
        <p rend="indent">All the Bones os the Carpus, Metacarpus, and Fingers, are
          <lb/>’crusted over with Curtilages at those Places, which I term'd
          <lb/>Cartilaginous Surfaces, in the Treatise os dry Bones: but in
          <lb/>fresh Bones they are thicker, softer, and whiter, than in the
          <lb/>Sceleton. In adult Subjects, then Figure remains the same
          <lb/>in both; but it changes in the dry Bones of younger Subjects,
          <lb/>and in those of Children it is quite different. The Impressions
          <lb/>and Notches in which the mucilaginous Glands are
          <lb/>lodged, are most sensible in the Cartilages of fresh Bones, because
          <lb/>of their Thickness.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Ligaments of the Carpus are very numerous. Some
          <lb/>of them tie each Bone to one or two neighbouring Bones in
          <lb/>the same Rank; and these are composed of a great Numher of
          <lb/>'Filaments, but so very short, as to allow these Bones only a
          <lb/>small Degree of Motion. Some os them tie the Bones of
          <lb/>one Row to those of the other ; which are likewise made up
          <lb/>of many Filaments, but not so short as the former, and therefore
          <lb/>allow these Bones,a more manifest Motion, as we see in
          <lb/>bending the Wrist. Lastly, there are other Ligaments of the
          <lb/>Carpus, by which the three first Bones of the first Row are
          <lb/>connected to the Bones of the sore Arm; and to thefe may be
          <lb/>added the Ligaments by winch the Bones of the second Row
          <lb/>are join'd to those of the Metacarpus, and first Phalanx of the
          <lb/>Thumb.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We have already describ'd all the Ligaments belonging to
          <lb/>the Articulation of the Carpus, with the Bones of the fore
          <lb/>‘ Arm, except their insertions in the Carpus. The Styloide
          <lb/>Ligament of the Radius is fixed round the neighbouring Tuberosity
          <lb/>of the OS Scaphoides. The Stybide Ligament of the
          <lb/>Ulna is fixed first in the Os Cuneiforme, and then in the Os
          <lb/>Uncisorme, from whence it is a little stretched over the fourth
          <lb/>Bone os the Metacarpus.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Ligamentary Ranges, which lie between the above-mention'd
          <lb/>Ligaments, tho Balis of the Radius, and a small Portion
          <lb/>of the Head of the Ulna, are fixed round the common Convexity
          <lb/>of the three first Carpal Bones, as is also the mucilaginous
          <lb/>Capsida, by which these Ligaments are lined.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Besides all these small short Ligaments belonging to each
          <lb/>Bone in both Rows, the rough Surfaces of all the Bones, espenally
          <lb/>those which form the Convexity of the Carpus, give
          <lb/>Insertion to a great many Ligamentary <hi>Fasciculi</hi>, stretched
          <lb/>over, and closely united to the former small Ligaments, and
          <lb/>serving, probably, to strengthen them. Some Fasciculi of
          <lb/>the same kind are found on the concave Side of the Carpus,
          <lb/>but they are fewer in Number, and not so strong.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There is likewise a considerable Ligamens, hasted the inner
          <lb/>transverse Ligament of the Carpus. It wua formerly <hi rend="u">rail</hi>ed an</p>
        <p>annular Ligament, and may still Very justly retain that Name
          <lb/>in the Sense already explain'd, when I spoke os the <hi rend="u">Ligaments</hi>
          <lb/>in general</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Bones os the Metacarpus, hesides the short Ligaments
          <lb/>by winch they are tied to the second Row of the Bones of the
          <lb/>Carpus, have several Rows, by which both their Bases and Heads
          <lb/>are connected together. The Bases of the third and fourth
          <lb/>Bones are not so closely tied as the rest, and therefore they
          <lb/>have a Very sensible Motion, which, however, is greater in the
          <lb/>fourth than in the third.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Heads of thefe Bones are firmly tied to each Other, by
          <lb/>a strong transverse Ligament, situated in the Palm of the Hand,
          <lb/>and fixed by distinct Productions in the neighbouring Part of
          <lb/>the Heads, in such a manner, as to form in the Spaces between
          <lb/>the Heads, as it were, perforated or chanel'd <hi>Prana,</hi>
          <lb/>through which the Tendons os the Flexor Muscles of the Fingers
          <lb/>have a free Passage, and these <hi>Dana</hi> are also supported
          <lb/>by aponeurotic Expansions.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The first Phalanx of the Thumb is fixed to the O<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Trapezium
          <lb/>by short Ligaments, which pass obliquely over the Articulation.
          <lb/>The first Phalanges of the other sour Fingers are
          <lb/>joined to the Heads of the Metacarpal Bones, almost in the
          <lb/>same manner, and by Ligaments like the former, which are
          <lb/>strengthen'd hy adhering to the transverse Ligament. The second
          <lb/>Phalanx of the Thumb is joined to the first* by Ligaments
          <lb/>of the same kind.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The third Phalanx of the Thumb is joined to the second ;
          <lb/>the second Phalanges of the other Fingers to the first, and the
          <lb/>third to the second, by lateral Ligaments almost in the same
          <lb/>manner as the Bones Of the fore Arm to the Os Humeri; that
          <lb/>is, these Ligaments spread from a Point fixed in rhe lateral
          <lb/>Tuhercles of the Heads of the Phalanges, and are infected by
          <lb/>their Other Extremity like <hi>Radiisuiu</hi>. the Bases of the neighbouring
          <lb/>Phalanges.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The two first Phalanges of each Finger have a Very strong .
          <lb/>Ligamentary <hi>Fagina</hi> inserted in the rough Lines or Ridges on
          <lb/>their flat Sides. These <hi>Fagina</hi> are fined with a mucilaginous
          <lb/>Membrane, which runs like a Tube, from one Phalanx to the
          <lb/>other, over the Articulation. They serve for <hi>Prana</hi> to the
          <lb/>Flexor Mufcles of the Fingers, the Tendons of which pass

        <p rend="indent">It would require a long Time to speak all that has been said

          <lb/>on this Subjeol, which he digested under genend Heads and

          <lb/>The Opinion of <hi>Cato</hi> concerning its Virtues deserves

        <p rend="indent">The most antient <hi>Greeks</hi> made three Species of Cabbage:

          <lb/>of its Leaves to .those of Apium. This Kind is
          <lb/>friendly to the Stomach, and gently mollifies the Belly. Another
          <lb/>Species was the <hi>fmaoth</hi>, shooting forth broad Leaves from
          <lb/>f its Stalk, whence it was call’d by seme <hi>Caulodes</hi>; It was of no
          <lb/>Use in Medicine. The third was properly call’d <hi>Crambe</hi>, which
          <lb/>produced thinner Leaves, plain, arid growing very thick together':
          <lb/>This is of a bitter Taste, but of great Virtues. <hi>Cato</hi>
          <lb/>most approves of the <hi>curled</hi>; next to which he prefers the
          <lb/><hi>sensoth</hi>, with the large Leaves, and great Stalk.</p>
        <p rend="indent">He tells us, that it is effectual for Pains of the Head, Dimness
          <lb/>of Sight, and Scintillations of the Eves; for the Spleen,
          <lb/>Stomach, and Praecordia,, if it be taken in the Morning raw,
          <lb/>in Vinegar and Honey, mix’d up with Coriander, Rue, Mint,
          <lb/>and the Root of Laser, to the Quantity of a Quarter of a Pint:

          <lb/>Person who bruises the Ingredients will feel an Increafe oi
          <lb/>Strength. It may be supp’d after it is bruised with thefe Simples,
          <lb/>or taken out of the Liquor and eaten. Min’d with Rue,
          <lb/>Coriander, a little Salt, and Barley-meal, it makes a Cataplasm
          <lb/>for the Gout. A Decoction of it in Water wonderfully help:
          <lb/>the Nerves and Joints; and is an effectual Fomentation for
          <lb/>Wounds, whether recent or old ; and even for, a Carcinoma,
          <lb/>which can be cured by no other Medicine. He first orders the
          <lb/>Part to be fomented with the warm Decoction, and the Herb
          <lb/>to be bruised and applied twice in a Day; and by the fame Method
          <lb/>are hollow Fistulas incarn’d, and Tumors discuss’d. Boil’d

          <lb/>into the Ears, and assures it tohegoed for Duiness of Hearing;
          <lb/>and says, moreover, that it cures the Impetigo without nine-,

          <lb/>orders it, aster two Boilings, with Salt, to be given to those

          <lb/>very effectual in Diseases of the Pudenda; and thet its Virtue
          <lb/>is increased by mixing it with Bean-meal. Mix’d with Rue, it

          <lb/>of boil’d Cabbage, so much commended for its manifold Usefulness,
          <lb/>stinks when pour’d upon the Ground. The Ashes of

        <p rend="indent">Are there, then, no ill Properties belonging to Cabbage?

        <p rend="indent"><hi>Cato</hi> is very diffuse in his Praises of the wild Cabbage, and
          <lb/>affirms, that the Powder of the dried Plant, made into an Ermine,
          <lb/>or the Smell of it alone, taken up the Nostrils, cures all
          <lb/>Defects, and amends the ill Scent therein. Some call this rhe
          <lb/>Rock Cabbage, and say, that It is a great Enemy to Wine,
          <lb/>thet the Vine avoids it above all things, and, if it cannot get
          <lb/>rid of it, dies. It has two small round smooth Leaves, and
          <lb/>is much like the Garden Colewort, but whiter and more hairy.
          <lb/><hi>Chrystppus</hi> recommends it for Inflations, and melancholy Disorders;
          <lb/>also for recent Wounds, being applied with Honey,
          <lb/>and not taken off hefore the seventh Day: For strumous Swellings
          <lb/>and Fistulas,: he orders it to he bruised in Water. Others
          <lb/>affirm, that it checks the Progress of spreading Ulcers, which
          <lb/>they call <hi>Narna</hi>; consumes Excrescences, and smooths the Skin
          <lb/>from Seams and Scars ; that being chew’d, or the Decoction of
          <lb/>it gargariz’d with Honey, it heals Ulcers of the Mouth, and
          <lb/>Affections of the Tonsils; and that three Parts of it, mix’d
          <lb/>with two Parts of Alum, in strong Vinegar, cure the Psora,
          <lb/>and inveterate Lepra, if anointed therewith. <hi>Epicharmus</hi> wist
          <lb/>heve the Application of it a sufficient Cure for the Bite of a
          <lb/>mad Dog ; bur it is more effectual with Laser and strong Vinegar.
          <lb/>It is alfo. said to kill Dogs, if given to them in Flesh.
          <lb/>The Seed, roasted, is a Remedy against the Venom of Serpents,
          <lb/>and the poisonous Effects of Mushrooms, and Bulk Blood.
          <lb/>The boil’d Leaves are given in Food for Disorders of the Spleen;
          <lb/>and are applied crude, with Sulphur and Nitre, by way os Cataplasm,

          <lb/>neceflary to the Preservation of Health. For this Reason
          <lb/>it is not only a Preservative against Diseases, especially of

          <lb/>Honey Or Manna, -which stows from them when laid in a cool
          <lb/>Place for some time, and which I have often experienced to he

          <lb/>.of Lemon-juice, and new Butter, is an excellent Remedy in
          <lb/>phthisical and hectic Disorders. The red Cabbage is preferable
          <lb/>to the white, in Cases where the Body is afflicted with Ulcers,
          <lb/>.since, in such Constitutions, the white soon assumes a putrid
          <lb/>.Quality, and becomes fetid. J am-of Opinion, that the moderateUse
          <lb/>of it may, in some Coses, produce salutary Effects;
          <lb/>but can't persuade myself to believe, that large Quantities of it,
          <lb/>frequently taken, supply the Body with laudable nutritious
          <lb/>Juices. Where Urine is to he provoked, or the Body render'd
          <lb/>soluble, it, by its stimulating Muriatic Acid, proves effectual,
          <lb/>with such as are not accustom’d to take Physic. Many People,

          <lb/>Cabbage plentifully drank, by the Country.people, has removed
          <lb/>continued Fevers, cured Dropsies, and carried off the most obstinate
          <lb/>Tertian Agues. When the Peasants of <hi>Croatia</hi> are seiz’d
          <lb/>with Fevers, they successfully apply Cataplasms os pickled Cabbage

          <lb/>.Inflammations in the Fauces, where the intention is to refrigerate
          <lb/>and repel, especially with an Addition of Lemon-juice.
          <lb/>Nor is unpickled Cabbage less useful for Various external Purposes,
          <lb/>fince it refrigerates, repeis, opens, and deterges. Thus
          <lb/>'tis usual, after Veltcatones are taken off, to apply the Leaves
          <lb/>..Of whine Cabbage, anointed with Butter; but they ought to he
          <lb/>removed every two Hours. According to <hi>Etmullen</hi>, they may
          <lb/>also be Very properly laid upon Issues, in order to carry on the
          <lb/>Discharge os the Matter, and prevent Consolidation. Nurses
          <lb/>also apply the Leaves of Cabbage to their Breasts, in order to
          <lb/>prevent Coagulations of their Milk, and hinder it from being
          <lb/>accumulated in too large a Quantity. Some apply them to
          <lb/>Abscesses of the Breast, in order to prevent Inflammations, and
          <lb/>promote the Consolidation of the Ulcer. The Country-people,
          <lb/>in order to cleanse Wounds and Ulcers, either pour the Juice
          <lb/>Of Cabbage into them, or lay its Leaves bruised to them. Some
          <lb/>use red Cabbage-leaves, aster having shipp'd off the outer Skin

          <lb/>to boil it with sat Flesh, that it may become tender, and easily
          <lb/>digested, and to eat it with gross-pounded Pepper, in order
          <lb/>to prevent Flatulencies. That Cabbage is of a hard Substance,
          <lb/>is obvious from its being render'd more sweet and tender by
          <lb/>Frosts, and nipping Colds; for 'tis probable, that its cornpressed

        <p rend="indent">Among the Antients it seems to have been a Tradition
          <lb/>commonly receiv'd, that Cabbage not only carried off the
          <lb/>troublesome Consequences of a Surfeit, but also guarded against
          <lb/>intoxication, is eat before a Drinking-match was undertaken
          <lb/>For this Reason, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were esteem'd a debauch'd and
          <lb/>intemperate People, because they used previoufly to eat heil'd
          <lb/>Cabbage, that they might indulge themselves the more freely
          <lb/>and immoderately over the social Bowl. The Seeds os the
          <lb/>Cabbage were also previousty taken by many, with a View to
          <lb/>prevent intoxication..Besides, the Antipathy between the Cabbage
          <lb/>and Vines was believ'd to he fo great, that the latter
          <lb/>yielded a poor and weak Wine, if the former happen'd to grow
          <lb/>near them. See <hi>Athen. L</hi>. I. <hi>C</hi>. 25. <hi>Alex. Trallian. L</hi>. I»
          <lb/><hi>C. IQ. Pallad. . R. R. L</hi>. 9. <hi>C. ζ</hi>. This Antipathy
          <lb/>they accounted for, by a Fable almost too ridiculous to he
          <lb/>mention'd. They affirm'd, that the Cabbage sprung from a
          <lb/>Tear shed by <hi>Lycurgus</hi>-, for, said they, when <hi>Bacchus</hi>, heing
          <lb/>afraid of <hi>Lycurgus</hi>, enter'd into the Sea, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in the
          <lb/>mean time, begirt with the pliant Branches os the Vine, dropt
          <lb/>a Tear, from which the Cabbage rose; and ever fince there
          <lb/>was an Antipathy betwixt the Vine and the Cabbage; for, say
          <lb/>they, when the Vine and Cabbage happen to grow near each
          <lb/>other, the Cabbage itself either decays immediately, or causes'
          <lb/>the Twigs of the Vine to do <hi>so. -They</hi> affirm'd also, that in
          <lb/>Consequence of this Antipathy, when the Uvula or Columel-ί
          <lb/>la was too much relaxed by a Destuxion of Humours, the
          <lb/>Juice of raw Cabbage applied to the Head drew it bach. They
          <lb/>maintain'd in like manner, that if Cabbage and Vine were
          <lb/>Planted near each other, the springing Shoots of the Vine,
          <lb/>when beginning to approach the Cabbage, ceased to come
          <lb/>forth in their former Direction, but were turned backwards,
          <lb/>as if they had been .conscious of the mutual Antipathy hetween
          <lb/>themselves and the Cabbage, in like manner they
          <lb/>said,' that when the least Quantity of Wine was pour'd upon
          <lb/>Cabbage when it was boiling, it would after that hecome
          <lb/>incapable of being boil'd, and have its Colour spoil'd. - <hi>Geopon.

          <lb/>removes the Consequences of hard Drinking; and seems, to
          <lb/>account for it, from its sweet and discutient Juice. Whether
          <lb/>what he advances on this Head is consonant to Philosophy,
          <lb/>and good Sense, or not, 'tis yet certain, that aqueous Liquids
          <lb/>possessed of an abstergent Quality, as the Juice of Cabbage is,
          <lb/>not only dilute the-Humours of Our Bedies, and allay, their
          <lb/>Fervor, hut also make a Revulsion from the superior to the
          <lb/>inferior Parts, and. consequently carry off a Crapula, by freeing
          <lb/>the Head from the offensive Matter; and that Cabbage,
          <lb/>eaten previoufly to a Debauch, dilutes the spirituous Liquors
          <lb/>drank, and blunts their . Strength, so as to make them act less
          <lb/>powerfully than : they .would otherwise do. But Experience
          <lb/>convinces us, that the Efficacy of Cabbage is not so great in

          <lb/>a very red Spray, and standing upon a single Pedicle, like those
          <lb/>of Ivy. Its Juice is white, but not copious., and tastes saltish,
          <lb/>with a kind of Bitterness, and is of a fat Consistence.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The whole Plant is hurtful to the Stomach, and acrimonious;

          <lb/>nitemately on the Stalks, in Shape and Bigness like the lesser

          <lb/>come forth at the Joints, with the Leaves in Shape like the

        <p>The Diseases in which <hi>Bristol</hi> Waters are more properly prescrib'd,
          <lb/>are internal Haemorrhages and Inflammations, Bloodspitting.
          <lb/>Dysentery, and immoderate Fluxes of the Menses,
          <lb/>purulent Ulcers of the Viscera : Hence in Consumptions, Dropsy,
          <lb/>Scurvy with Heat, call'd by Dr. <hi>VVillis, Scorbutus sulphureofalinus</hi>.
          <lb/>Stone, Gravel, Strangury, the Habitual Gout, thet
          <lb/>kind of Rheumatism which Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> terms Scorbutic, Dinbetes,
          <lb/>flow FeVers, Atrophy, Pox, Cancer, Gleets in both
          <lb/>Sexes, and King’s-evil, in these Disorders <hi>Bath</hi> Waters are
          <lb/>not only improper, but hurtful; they rouse the too languid, and
          <lb/>quicken the too lazy Circulation ; these allav the Heat, and
          <lb/>restrain the too rapid Motion of the Blood : Those impregnate
          <lb/>the phlegmatic; these attemperate the choleric Constitution.
          <lb/><hi>Bath</hi> Waters seem to he adapted to the Maladies of the Stomach,
          <lb/>Guts, and Nerves; <hi>Bristol, to</hi> those of the Lungs,
          <lb/>Kidneys, and Bladder. Again, <hi>Bath</hi> Waters are at Variance
          <lb/>with a Milk-course; and the <hi>Bristol</hi> can never be judiciously
          <lb/>directed, but where that may he joined with Reason and Success.
          <lb/>This is so great a Truth, that it holds even in the Diabetes,
          <lb/>in which Milk is of great Service, and prescrib’d as early
          <lb/>as the Age of <hi>Aretaus</hi>, whe, say the Learned, is at least aS antiebt
          <lb/>as <hi>Galen</hi> : Tho' that this Disease was little known to Antiquity,
          <lb/>is certain, since it is not once mention'd by <hi>Hippocrates .♦ .
          <lb/>Galen says</hi> he never saw it but twice ; and Rabbi <hi>Moses</hi> assirms
          <lb/>the Diabetes is Very seldom seen in the Western Parts of the
          <lb/>World, but Oftener in the het and Eastern Countries, insomuch
          <lb/>that, in <hi>Egypt</hi>, in ten Years Practice, he saw more than twenty
          <lb/>Patients of this kind ; but we fee a greater Numher, almost
          <lb/>every. Year, in our Western World. . '
          <lb/>♦ Perhaps some may he surpris'd to find <hi>Bristol</hi> Waters prescrib'd
          <lb/>in Dropsies, in which Authors order also those of <hi>Bath?</hi>
          <lb/>but which of the two, with hest Judgment, is worth while to
          <lb/>inquire. That diuretic and drying Medicines are of great Service
          <lb/>in this Disease, no one can doubt; that <hi>Bristol</hi> Waters
          <lb/>have these two Qualities in a greater Degree than the other, is
          <lb/>also as evident. For which Reason I should prefer the <hi>Bristol</hi> to
          <lb/><hi>Bathe</hi> in this' Instance, unless where it happens, as it too often
          <lb/>does,' that a Jaundice attends it; and here <hi>Bath</hi> claims the Precedence,
          <lb/>from its great Efficacy in opening Obstructions of the
          <lb/>Viscera, where there is no formidable Inflammation.</p>
        <p>But there is another Question of more Importance, and that
          <lb/>is. Whether <hi>Bristol</hi> Water be specific in the Diabetes ? A specific
          <lb/>Remedy for each Disease would prove in Physic, what
          <lb/>finding the Longitude must in Navigation: We should go directly
          <lb/>to the Cure, without the Circle of the alteratiVe Course;
          <lb/>But, at present, there is as littie Probability of discovering the
          <lb/>one, as the other. We know but One Specific^ and but one
          <lb/>Disease cur'd by it, unless I can prove this to he such in the
          <lb/>Diahetes.-</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Diabetes, then, is defin'd to he the too quick and-large
          <lb/>Excretion of crude, unalter'd, and sweet-tasting Water, exseeding
          <lb/>the Proportion of the Fluids taken into the Body, accompanied
          <lb/>with intolerable Thirst: And a specific Medicine is
          <lb/>that which cures a Difeafe, without promoting any sensible
          <lb/>Evacuation.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Suppose then a Person labouring under a Diabetes, voids a
          <lb/>given Quantity of fuch Urine, (for Example, four or five Quarts
          <lb/>in twenty-sour Hours) let him drink as many of this Water,
          <lb/>and he shall* excrete less daily ; from whence it is manifest, that
          <lb/>it proves no Evacuant. Another Argument to prove it specific
          <lb/>is, that, in this Instance, we need not observe the Rule
          <lb/>of d<hi rend="u">rinking</hi> Mineral Waters in small Quantities ; - <hi>for</hi> 'tin
          <lb/>specific, and may he taken in as: large Doses as. the Stomach
          <lb/>will bear ; and this is no bad News to a Person dying with
          <lb/>Thirst. In all other Disorders, where it acts by its contemperating,
          <lb/>alterative, and healing Qualities, the Rule holds
          <lb/>good. A third is, that'we see, by daily Experiments, its Effect
          <lb/>in Diahetes more quick and sudden tharrin any other Dis.

        <p>There is a large and round Tumor of the Neck, which takes
          <lb/>its Name from the inward Parts, and is called <hi>Bronehocele, of .</hi>
          <lb/>which there are two Kinds, the <hi>steatomatous</hi>, and the <hi>eurysenatous
          <lb/>fnvsuafjjf/sasns</hi> ). This letter is known by the fame Marks
          <lb/>as an Aneurystn; and the Cure of it, for the same Reafons, is
          <lb/>look’d upon as desperate; for as almost all Aneurysms are dangerous
          <lb/>in the Operation, st, especially is an Aneurysm about the
          <lb/>Neck, because of the Largeness of the Arteries. The steatomatous
          <lb/>Tumor is to be treated like a Steatoma, by separatiog
          <lb/>and passing beyond the Vessels, in the fame manner as we arc
          <lb/>directed in strumous Cases, <hi>P. Acginet. Lila</hi> 6. <hi>Cap</hi>. 38.</p>
        <p><hi>Albucasts</hi>, treating of a Bronctiocele, or a Rupture in the fore
          <lb/>Part of the Neck, which, he fays, is most frequent in Women,
          <lb/>is fuller then the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Celsos</hi> ; and he very rightly distinguishes
          <lb/>hetween .that which is natural, and that which is accidental.
          <lb/>The first Sort is not to be touch’d. Of the second
          <lb/>there are two Species; one like a Tumor, which contains some
          <lb/>gross Substance ; the other like an Aneurysm. But though hs
          <lb/>is fo held in using the Knife, he advises the Operation only in
          <lb/>the former Case;i-and even not there neither, unless the Tumor
          <lb/>he loose, and ilittle, and inclosed in a Cystis. This Sort
          <lb/>of Swelling may, no doubt, he removed by Art. Sometimes
          <lb/>these Excrescences are full of Water, sometimes they heve nothing
          <lb/>in, them but Air; and these Cafes may likewise be remedied.
          <lb/>by. Incision, .Friction, or Compression. Sometimes they
          <lb/>turn to a fleshy Substance, which, lying hetween the Skin and
          <lb/>the Wind-pipe, resembles a Flap or Dew-cap banging out,
          <lb/>just like that of -a- Turky-eock, when he is angry. This is a
          <lb/>frequent Distemper<hi rend="sup">L</hi>in. those Countries where they drink great
          <lb/>' Quantities of cold Water; especially where they do not cool
          <lb/>i their Water in Snow,, <hi>zs</hi> in other warm di mates; but pour Ico

          <lb/>the bleak Mountains, <hi>osGenoa</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi>. The Matter of
          <lb/>Facti is as true, as that they themselves attribute it to the drink’
          <lb/>rug this Water j and from the Nature of Cold, it is not dissi:
          <lb/>cult to account for . thisEffeet : For the Liquor in going down,
          <lb/>must, needs, chill .the-Muscles of the Throat, thet is, it contracts
          <lb/>the-Vessels,-,and. thickens the Humours which circulate
          <lb/>' through them at :the same time; from whence must follow a
          <lb/>' Stagnation or Obstruction, and, after a while, a Swelling, in
          <lb/>ν thofe Parts., And-jt.is remarkable, that Tumors, which owe

          <lb/>indulge themselves immoderately in the Use os cold
          <lb/>iquors. And that: the Coldness not only ofctie Liquors, but
          <lb/>of, the.Gliinate itself, may produce these Effects, seems to be
          <lb/>plnin, from: the Observations we find in Writers, that there.
          <lb/>Swellings about the Throat and Head are much more frequent
          <lb/>ainong the Northern Nations, than the Southern.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Turners very osten' happen in the Thyroidal Glands ; but
          <lb/>fuctiS Swelling is not properly a <hi>Branchecele</hi>, though sometimes

          <lb/>.3 is thus confirm’d, we may easily learn from Anatomy, were
          <lb/>we rior tyarn’ss of it, _thet the Distemper is in its own Nature

        <p rend="indent">There are others who derive their Origin from some nutritious
          <lb/>Juice extravasate, and turning into a Flesh-like Substance,
          <lb/>after the manner of certain other -Sarcomata; and indeed both
          <lb/>these may be right, since we Often find the Body thereof
          <lb/>made up partly of a fluid, and partly of a more firm and
          <lb/>glandulous Substance t But to proceed to the Prognostic and

        <p rend="indent">The <hi>Bronchocele</hi>, by reason of its unhappy Situation among
          <lb/>the large Blood-Vessels, the recurrent Nerves, and Windpipe itself
          <lb/>therein concern'd, at least its investing Tunicle, affordsa.Very
          <lb/>hazardous and uncertain Issue ; and if it admit not of Discussion,
          <lb/>there is little Encouragement to meddle farther: For
          <lb/>if it suppurates, there is left commonly a Very fordid and sinuous
          <lb/>Ulcer, which fince you cannot dilate so conveniently as in .
          <lb/>other Parts might he done, nor have any Advantage by rolling,
          <lb/>which the same will not allow, you may he put upon risquing
          <lb/>your Patient's Life, or leave him in a Condition worse than
          <lb/>you found him, with an incurable gleeting Fistula, or Dysepulotic
          <lb/>Ulcer; so thet if any thing he done in order for the.
          <lb/>Cure, it ought always to be attempted first Of all by some pro- .
          <lb/>per Discutient. For this Use alfo serves the Ernpl Antimoniale
          <lb/>of Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi>, to he met with in his <hi>Pharmacopoeia
          <lb/>extemp</hi>, but indeed these Tumors are most Commonly left to
          <lb/>themselves; the great Danger by incision on account of
          <lb/>their Situation, and the Difficulty of healing when they come
          <lb/>to suppurate, having Very much discourag'd their Undertak-</p>
        <p>ing. Wherefore the much greater Number now content
          <lb/>themselves without any Surgery, when apprised of their stubborn
          <lb/>Nature, and the Uncertainty of Success.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tis much more rare to find these Tumors in the Necks of
          <lb/>Men than Women, or at least-wise, being less obvious to Sight,
          <lb/>they pass unheeded, and we are not so often consulted about
          <lb/>them. I am sure, to one that I have observed in our Sex, I
          <lb/>have met with half a Dozen on the Throats os Women.</p>
        <p rend="indent">That the Nature Os this Tumor may he the hetter apprehended,
          <lb/>I will here transfer an Account thereof, presented by the <hi rend="sup">Ύ</hi>
          <lb/>ingenious Dr. <hi>Douglafs</hi> to the <hi>Papal Society</hi>, in these Words,</p>
        <p rend="indent">I had lately <hi>{faith he</hi>) the Opportunity of opening 2
          <lb/>Woman about fifty Years old, who had. a Very large
          <lb/>Tumor, or hard Swelling, in the fore Part of the Neck, pos.'
          <lb/>fessing all the Space between the whole Extent of the lower
          <lb/>jaw, and the upper Part of the Sternum, with a Considerable
          <lb/>Rising in its Middle, laterally its Point inclining to the
          <lb/>Left Side, though the biggest Part of the Tumor was on
          <lb/>the Right. The Skin on the Apex of this protuberating
          <lb/>Part was thin and shrival'd, of a Colour, different from
          <lb/>the rest, and look'd as if the Swelling would have broke in
          <lb/>that Place.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Skin was exceeding thin, having no Fat under it, only
          <lb/>in a Cavity between two Lobes, to he afterwards describ'd.
          <lb/>On its Right Side there was a small Appearance of some; forthe
          <lb/>Skin heing less stretch'd there, the Celis of the Membrana
          <lb/>Adiposa were not quite emptied. The fleshy Fibres of the :
          <lb/><hi>Latissimus Colli</hi> were scarcely Visible, the <hi>Mastoidaeus</hi> and
          <lb/><hi>Coracohyoidaeus</hi> were extremely thin, and in their Ascent they
          <lb/>adher'd Very firmly to the subjacent Turnon The <hi>Sternohyoidaeus</hi>,
          <lb/>and the <hi>Stcrnothyreoidaeus</hi> that run up the fore Part es
          <lb/>this Swelling, were distended so thin, that it was difficult,
          <lb/>to separate them, especially the last named. The Right Carotid '
          <lb/>Artery, in its Ascent to the Head, ran along the outer Edge, which
          <lb/>increasing, much obstructed the Current of the Blond
          <lb/>that Way. - .</p>
        <p rend="indent">The internal Jugular, the Par Vagum, and the Intercostal’'
          <lb/>Pain, went also over some Part of this Swelling, in their Descent
          <lb/>to the Thorax ; two of the Lymphatic Glands Of the Jti-.
          <lb/>gular Vein were swelled to the Bigness of littie Eggs, being
          <lb/>placed at some Distance one from the other, with a Hollow
          <lb/>between, where some Fat was found; these two Lobes made'
          <lb/>the Tumor very uneven alfo on its Right Side. -</p>
        <p rend="indent">These Muscles, the Jugular with the Glands adhering to
          <lb/>it, and the rest of the forenamed Vessels, being remov’d on
          <lb/>both Sides, I could easily observe the Bigness, the Figure, anth
          <lb/>the Circumscription or Limits of this preternatural Tumor,.
          <lb/>with all its Adhesions to the adjacent Parts. In Magnitude it χ
          <lb/>seem'd to exceed that of two FistS join'd together: Its Figured
          <lb/>was almost triangular, with a broad Basis under the Chin,
          <lb/>stoping a littie on each Side, as it descended to the upper Part
          <lb/>os the Sternum,, where its Point was pretty narrow; its Sur- S
          <lb/>face was made uneven by three Risings, of which the largest
          <lb/>was turn’d to the Leftside, the other being plac'd on the
          <lb/>Right, as above remark'd. It adher'd by membranous Filaments
          <lb/>to the maxillary Glands, to the <hi>Digastric</hi> Muscle, and
          <lb/>to the <hi>Stylohyoid ecus</hi>, under which, on the Right Side, Ἀ small
          <lb/>Portion of it, in the Form of a Nipple, did intrude itself, as
          <lb/>it were, under the Tongue; in the upper <hi rend="sup">a</hi>nd sore Part in
          <lb/>also adhered to the <hi>Os Hyoides</hi>.</p>
        <p>Laterally it was connected to the <hi>Levator Scapula</hi>, and
          <lb/>lower down to that Part of the <hi>Cucullaris</hi>, which terminates
          <lb/>in the Clavicles backwards, to all the fore Part of the Aspera
          <lb/>Arteris, hetween its third and fourth cartilaginous Rings, and
          <lb/>the OS Pectoris, as also to that Muscle of the Head called
          <lb/><hi>Rectus internus major</hi>, and to some Part of the <hi>Scaleni</hi>; its
          <lb/>lower Part was engag'd under the Jugulum, or lunated Part
          <lb/>of the Breast-bone to which it adhered. It was easily freed
          <lb/>from its Connexions to all these different Parts, but not so
          <lb/>from the Glandulae Thyreoidae, to which it adher'd after A
          <lb/>sar different manner; for where the Thyreoidal Glands are
          <lb/>Joined to One another, a little helow the <hi>Cartilago Cricoides,</hi>
          <lb/>on the fore Part of the Aspera Arteria, there was no separating
          <lb/>of it without cutting its Substance; whence it plainly appears,
          <lb/>that the Union of these Glands was the Root or Beginning of
          <lb/>this Tumor; and yet, which is very remarkable, the Glands
          <lb/>themfelves kept their usual Figure, and were no larger than
          <lb/>Ordinary.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Tumor was hard; and very firm, heing exactly of the
          <lb/>Consistence of a Cowss Udder when boiled; yet in a few
          <lb/>Places it was softish, containing a liquid and thick Juice. Its
          <lb/>Calour was chiefly of a whitish-yellow, only in some Places it
          <lb/>was exceeding red, from its having a greater Store of Bloodvessels,
          <lb/>and in others it was very white; I. pared off all the
          <lb/>soft Part, and the hard Substance; that remain'd; I bod'd, and
          <lb/>then clear'd it very well, having left sticking to it at one Cena
          <lb/>tre a soft cartilaginous Body, which possibly, had the Patient
          <lb/>lived longer, would have acquir'd the same Degree of induration.
          <lb/>It very much resembles a Piece of white unpolish'd
          <lb/>Rock Coral ; het whether it may he reckon'd osseous, or if it
          <lb/>he rather the viscid Humour of the Glands, hardened and eoncreted
          <lb/>into this irregular, chalky or gravelly Substance, or
          <lb/>whatever else it may he, I leave to hetter Judgments.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The first Appearance of this- large Swelling was about thirty
          <lb/>Years ago, caused hy the breaking of a Vein, as the good

          <lb/>had bee» used, and applied unsuccessfully: Its Bigness af
          <lb/>length became very troublesome, in impeding her Swallowing

          <lb/>on the Outside, and White within, of a bitter unpleasant Taste.

          <lb/>The Leaves are, in Shape, like Vine-leaves, whence it is call'd

          <lb/>.thro' winch his Works have pass'd, have made him say a thing

          <lb/>that it may accidentally produce this Effect by purging such
          <lb/>Nurses aS are Valetudinary, and in a had State of Health; for
          <lb/>all the Parts of the Plant are of an acrid exulcerating Quality;
          <lb/>which <hi>Mefue, R</hi>. III. Z.2. Co 25. seems to have had in his
          <lb/>View, when he uses these Words: " Its young Shoots, when
          <lb/>" they first appear, are principally used with Aromatics, and cor"
          <lb/>rect the fetid and disagreeable Smell of the Breath, especial"
          <lb/>ly when that Misfortune proceeds from a Corruption of the
          <lb/>" Humours lodged in the Stomach." For, by the Addition of
          <lb/>the Aromatics, the drasho purgative Quality of the Plant must,
          <lb/>in some measure, be corrected and balanced. The same Author,
          <lb/>sor a Purge, prescribes from one Dram to two DramS of
          <lb/>the Juice of its Root; and os isself, in Substance, from one
          <lb/>Dram and an half to three DramS. Later Authors have observed,
          <lb/>that not only the Roots, but also the young Shoots and
          <lb/>Berries, are possess'd of a very drastic and powerful purgative
          <lb/>Quality, and must consequentiy he proper for removing Obstructions.
          <lb/>The Root alone is, at present, used for medicinal
          <lb/>Purposes ; and Authors, I believe, are sufficiently agreed, that it
          <lb/>is intolerably acrimonious and nauseous, that it provokes Urine,
          <lb/>purges Violently, and vomits briskly. It is generally class'd
          <lb/>among the phleginagogue and hydragogue Medicines; and is,
          <lb/>on account os the Violence with which it operates. Call'd <hi>Rusticorum
          <lb/>Purgatio</hi>, the Purge of the common People. The Dose
          <lb/>os the Roos, reduced to Powder, is from two Scruples to one
          <lb/>Dram : Hals an Ounce of itS Juice may he given; and three
          <lb/>Drams of infusions or Decoctions of it may be used. But to
          <lb/>whatever internal Purposes it is used, <hi>Tournesert</hi> thinks it expedient
          <lb/>to correct its strong and drastic Qualities, by the Addition
          <lb/>os a proper Quantity os Cream <hi>us Tartar, or Tartarus Tartari.,
          <lb/>sutus</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">According to <hi>Le Mort</hi>, an excellent Purge is prepared Of

          <lb/>; and lastly, <hi>dry</hi> the Whole, either over a Very flow

          <lb/>that Part of it which is left in the Ground, covering it over
          <lb/>.with that Part of the Root which was cut off, in order to hinder
          <lb/>Dust and Earth from selling into the Cavity, we shall next
          <lb/>Day; upon uncovering it, find it full of a certain milky Juice,
          <lb/>which continues in it till the third Day; and that a Spoonful of
          <lb/>.this Juice purges a Man no less safely than speedily.. <hi>Kay</hi> also,
          <lb/>from <hi>Dolaeus</hi>, informs us; that by taking from one to. two or
          <lb/>three Spoonfuls of this Juice every:Morning, many dropsical
          <lb/>Patients have been cured; provided the Juice has been gather'd
          <lb/>.in the Spring of the Year, when the Moon is increasing.</p>
        <p><hi>Hoffman</hi> acquaints us; that <hi>Platerns</hi> took the white Bryonyroot
          <lb/>before it germinated ; and, after pulling off the Bark, and
          <lb/>.cutting it into Sbreds, pass’d a Thread thro' it, and hung it up
          <lb/>to dry, either by the Heat Of the Sun, or that of the Fire ;
          <lb/>.and that; when it was sufficiently dry, he infused it in generous
          <lb/>-Wine, and dried it a second time. This Method he repeated
          <lb/>several times, and affirm'd, that, when thus prepared, it purged
          <lb/>.excellently, and without, creating any Uneasiness. The same
          <lb/>Author prepares Troches of white Bryony in this manner:</p>
        <p rend="hanging">He reduces the Bryony, thus corrected, to a Powder; and,
          <lb/>. aster sprinkling it with <hi>Malmsey</hi> Wine, in winch Ginger</p>
        <p>has been infused, he forms it into small Cakes, which;
          <lb/>when dry, he reduces to a Powder, and uses,in Infusions:
          <lb/>When thus prepared, it purges, according to that Author,
          <lb/>in the same manner the Troches of Agaric do.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Now since this Root, when used internally, acts by its stimtrlating
          <lb/>and resolvent Acrimony, 'tis obvious, that it may be exhibited
          <lb/>with Success in Cases where heating Medicines are indicated,
          <lb/>and when the Intention is to stimulate the Nerves
          <lb/>strongly, and give a Concussion to the whole System. To this
          <lb/>Quality it is also owing, that it is so much extol'd in Intermitting
          <lb/>Fevers, in provoking the Menses, curing those uterine
          <lb/>Disorders to which young Women are subject, and in killing
          <lb/>and diflodgingWorms lodged in the Intestines; for; being possess'd
          <lb/>of a highly drastic V irtue, it powerfully incides the tenacious

          <lb/>Thus <hi>Ray</hi> informs us, that the Bulk of a Nutmeg of the Conserve
          <lb/>made of its Root, taken twice a Day, and persisted in for
          <lb/>a long time, often proves the happy Means of removing and
          <lb/>entirely curing Epilepsies, and hysteric Passions; and that the
          <lb/>same good Effect is produced by continually putting a Piece of
          <lb/>its Root into the Cup, out of which the Patient drinks. <hi>Bauhine</hi>,
          <lb/>from <hi>Arnaldus de Villa Nova</hi>, gives us the History of a
          <lb/>certain Patient, who, in the Space of three Weeks time, was
          <lb/>completely cured of an Epilepsy, only by purging himself with
          <lb/>depurated Juice of Bryony, edulcorated with a little Sugar.
          <lb/><hi>Matthiolus</hi>, in his Commentaries on <hi>Diofcorides</hi>, informs us,
          <lb/>that he knew a certain Woman, who, for several Years, had
          <lb/>been daily subject to hysteric Fits ; and who was at last advised,
          <lb/>by a common Herb-man, once a Week, when going to Bed,
          <lb/>to drink White-wine, in which an Ounce of Bryony-root had
          <lb/>heen boil'd; by which Medicine, Continued sor a I ear, her
          <lb/>Disorder was entirely removed. <hi>Forestus, Obs. Chir. L. 6. Obs.</hi>22.
          <lb/><hi>Schol</hi>, informs us, from <hi>Avicenna</hi>, that Patients render’d
          <lb/>delirious by dangerous Wounds, are in a great measure restor'd,
          <lb/>either by drinking Bryony-root for some Days, in some refrigerating
          <lb/>and diluting Liquor, Or using it in any proper Fond,
          <lb/>capable of obtunding and blunting its Taste. The Root, externally
          <lb/>applied, has, in many Cases, given incontested Proofs
          <lb/>of its resolvent Catalines. When newly bruised, and min’d up
          <lb/>with Salt and Vinegar, it resolves cold Tumors, and removes
          <lb/>the discolour'd Marks arising from extravasated Blood, if applied
          <lb/>to them. <hi>Helmont</hi> affirms, that in Contusions, where a
          <lb/>black discolour'd Blood is lodged under the Skin, Bryony-root
          <lb/>alone, shaVed down and applied, will, in a few Hours, resolve
          <lb/>the Blood into Water, and draw it thro' the Pores os the Skin.
          <lb/>According to <hi>Etrnuller</hi>, Bryony-root not only cures the Dropsy,
          <lb/>when exhibited internally, but also evacuates the Waters collected
          <lb/>in the Abdomen, when applied externally, by way os Cotaplasm,
          <lb/>to the Region os the Loins, either bruised by itself, or
          <lb/>made up with the Dung of a Cow, the Pigeon’s, or Goat's. It
          <lb/>is also applied to oedematous Swellings Of the Feet and Legs, a
          <lb/>Hydrocele of the Scrotum, and other Disorders of a similar
          <lb/>Nature, in wlrich Cases it carries off the Serum, and consequently

          <lb/>Chelidonium, Melothrum, Psilothrum, Archeooostis, A grasses</hi>, and
          <lb/><hi>. Cede esses</hi>, in its Branches, Leaves, and Tendriis, resembles the
          <lb/>cultivated Vine, only is more hairy, in every Part. It twines
          <lb/>about the neighbouring Shrubs, taking hold of them by its Tendrils.
          <lb/>Its Print grows in Clusters, of a deep Yellow, and is
          <lb/>used by the Tanners in taking off the Hairs from their Skins.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The tender Shoots of the first Budding, being boil’d and
          <lb/>eaten, loosen the Belly, and provoke Urine. The Leaves,
          <lb/>Fruit, and Root, are of an acrimonious Quality; and therefore
          <lb/>proper, being made into a Cataplasm with Salt, for <hi>Chironian,</hi>
          <lb/>gangrenous, and phagedenic Ulcers, and for putrid Ulcers in
          <lb/>.the Legs, The Root, with bitter Vetches, Earth of <hi>Chios,</hi>
          <lb/>and Fenugreek, absterges and clears the Skin from Wrinkles,
          <lb/>Sun-burns, Freckles, and black Marks. Boil'd in Oil till it
          <lb/>be liquesy'd and dissolved, it works the same Effects. It takes
          <lb/>off the livid Marks of Blows in the Face, and represses the
          <lb/><hi>Pterygia of</hi> the Fingers. Applied in a Cataplasm with Wine,
          <lb/>it discusses Inflammations, and breaks Abscesses; and the
          <lb/>Powder of it, in a Cataplasm, extracts Splinters of Bones:
          <lb/>It is a proper Ingredient in septic or suppurative Medicines.
          <lb/>A Drain thereof, drank every Day for a whole Year, is a Medicine
          <lb/>sor the Epilepsy ; and is good for those who are subject to
          <lb/>' an Apoplexy or Vertigo. Two Drams of it, drank, are
          <lb/>effectual against the Bite os the Viper, and kill the Child in the
          <lb/>Womb. Sometimes it (lightly disturbs the Reason. Being
          <lb/>drank, it provokes Urine ; and, apply'd as a Pessary, extractis
          <lb/>both Birth and Afterbirth. It is made into an Eclegma with
          <lb/>- Honey, for the Use of thofe who am oppress’d with a Strangulation,
          <lb/>or a Dyspnoea, and sor Coughs, Pains in the Sides,
          <lb/>Ruptures, and Convulsions. Half a Dram of it, taken in
          <lb/>Vinegar, sor thirty Days together, wastes the Spleen; and,
          <lb/>applied by way of Cataplasm with a Fig to the Place, is effec,
          <lb/>tual for the same Purpose. Its Decoction is proper sor Insessions,
          <lb/>* heing a Purger of the Uterus, and expelling the dead Foetus.</p>
        <p>The Juice is expressed from the Root in the Spring-time, and
          <lb/>is drank in Hydroinel Tor the foremention'd Purposes,’ being a
          <lb/>Phlegmagogue. The Fruit, us'd by way of Unction, hr Cataplasm,

        <p rend="indent">The black Vine, which some call black Bryony,' others the
          <lb/><hi>Chironian</hi> Vine, has Leaves like Ivy, but more nearly resembling
          <lb/>those of the Smilax, only larger; their Stalks also are
          <lb/>alike. This Plant, as well aS the white Bryony, takes hold of
          <lb/>.the neighbouring Trees by its Tendriis. The Fruit grows in
          <lb/>Clusters, and is green at first, but black when ripe. The Root
          <lb/>is black on the Outside, but of the Colour of Box within.
          <lb/>. The Shoots of the first Budding are eaten as other Greens.</p>
        <p rend="indent">They provoke Urine and the Menses, waste the Spleen, and
          <lb/>are good for epileptical. Vertiginous, and paralytical Persons.
          <lb/>The Root has the same Virtues as that of the white Vine, and
          <lb/>performs the same Effects, but in a less efficacious manner.
          <lb/>A Cataplasm of the Leaves with Wine cures the gall'd and
          <lb/>ulcerated Necks of Beasts of Burden, and is apply'd also to

          <lb/>as Food, are preferr'd, by <hi>Dioclet</hi>, hesore Asparagus, for provoking
          <lb/>Urine, and diminishing the Spleen. It delights to grow
          <lb/>among Shrubs and Reeds ; the Root is black on the Outside,
          <lb/>but of the Colour of Box within, and is more effectual in extracting
          <lb/>Splinters of Bones, than the white Vine; but it has

          <lb/>Explication. . <hi>N mild</hi> Bubo is so nam'd, first, when it rises,
          <lb/>. as it were, fpontaneoufly ; that is, when the Patientis in a State
          <lb/>Os Health, and wholly free from any. contagious Tor pestilential
          <lb/>Disease, in the same manner-as a Furunculus, or Phlegmon;
          <lb/>arises, especially on infants ; .thossfor.the most Tint, without
          <lb/>Danger: Or, secondly, a Bubo, is said to be <hi>mild</hi>, when it
          <lb/>makes its Appearance at the End of some mild and. favourable
          <lb/>kind of Fever, the Violence of the Disease heing,' by the
          <lb/>Strength os Nature, diverted that Way. A <hi>malignant</hi> Bubo is
          <lb/>one which owes its Rise to some pestilential Contagion, or the
          <lb/>Lues Venerea, and is therefore usually call'd a <hi>pestilential</hi> or
          <lb/><hi>venereal</hi> Bubo.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As to the Causes of a mild Bubo, I must remark, that this,
          <lb/>.as well as. all other Inflammations proceeding from internal
          <lb/>Causes, takes its Rise from the Stagnation of some glutinous
          <lb/>arid inspissated Blond, and, consequently, no way differs from
          <lb/>Other inflammations, except its Place, which is in the Groin or
          <lb/>Armpit, where much Fat, and many Glands, are situated.</p>
        <p rend="indent">A mild Bubo is not difficult to be distinguish'd, if we consider,
          <lb/>that it is nothing but a Tumor, with an Inflammation, in the
          <lb/>Parts above-mention'd, without any pestilential or Venereal
          <lb/>Contagion. ...Ἀ ..</p>
        <p rend="indent">This kind of <hi>Bubo</hi> also is Very seldom of dangerous or pernicious
          <lb/>Consequence, heing commonly resolv'd, or brought to
          <lb/>a Suppuration. But this Resolution or Suppuration is sometimes
          <lb/>brought about with Difficulty, especially in Persons of a bad
          <lb/>Habit of Body, insomuch that these suppurated Tumors heve
          <lb/>sometimes ended in stubborn Fistulas. A Bubo in the Armpit
          <lb/>is more easily brought to a Suppuration than one in the Groin ;
          <lb/>but neither os them. is so difficult os Suppuration as the Parotides.
          <lb/></p>
        <p rend="indent">For Buboes which happen without any other Distemper,
          <lb/>especially in Infants, the best way is often to administer frequentiy
          <lb/>some purging Medicine, mix'd with Mercurius dulcis,
          <lb/>thet the glutinous and coagulated Blood may be drawn by Re.Vulfion
          <lb/>from the affected Part, and, at the same time, dissolv'd.
          <lb/>Then other Medicines, which attenuate the Blood, are to be
          <lb/>prescrib'd, as Decoctions of the Woods. If the Bubo be attended
          <lb/>with a flight Fever, a Physician ought to be .consulted,
          <lb/>. /or administring some antifebrile Medicines.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Where the inflammation is but moderate, and, consequently.
          <lb/>Resolution may be hep'd, it will be proper to apply digestive
          <lb/>Plaisters, such as those of simple Diachylum, Sperma Ceti,
          <lb/>Galbanum, DiasaponiS, or De Ranis com Mercurio; for
          <lb/>these sorts of Tumors are often resolv'd by such external Applications.
          <lb/>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If the Inflammation be Violent, and the Pain intense, or if
          <lb/>Outward Digestives heve no Effect, we are immediately to have
          <lb/>recourse to Suppuration, by applying a Plaister of <hi>Diachylum
          <lb/>cum Gumrni</hi>, which is of excellent Service in this Case. If
          <lb/>the Pain be Very great and intolerable, digestive Cataplasms,
          <lb/>applied warm to the affected Part, and often chang'd, are usually
          <lb/>of Very great Efficacy, not only in mitigating the Pain, but
          <lb/>resolving the Tumor.' Cataplasms for this Purpose may be compos'd
          <lb/>of Crums00s wheaten Bread, and Milk, bod’d to a
          <lb/>Poultis, with an Addition of some Saffron ; or of Meal, with
          <lb/>Honey and fresh Butter, work'd to a Cataplasm bv the Firefide;
          <lb/>to which may conveniently be added a small Quantity of
          <lb/><hi>Venice</hi> Treacle. This is to be apply'd hot, and often chang'd.
          <lb/>’ When, by these and such-like Medicines, we have reduc’d
          <lb/>the stagnating Matter to Maturation, we are to make use of
          <lb/>some Caustic, or of the Knife; bet all imaginable Care is to
          <lb/>be taken, that, in making an Incision, we do not injure the
          <lb/>axillary Vessels under the Armpit, or the crural Vessels which
          <lb/>lie under the Groin, and, by that means, excite a Very dangerous

        <p><orth>PESTILENTIAL</orth> BUBOES..</p>
        <p rend="indent">Pestilential Tumors are, by Professors Of Surgery, generally
          <lb/>- divided into <hi>Buboes</hi>, and <hi>Carbuncles</hi>, or <hi>Anthraces</hi>. . Under the
          <lb/>Name of <hi>Bubo</hi> they comprehend all inflammatory Tumors
          <lb/>from a pestilential Cause, which arise not only finder the ears,
          <lb/>in the Armpits, and in the Groin, but alfo in the Neck, on
          <lb/>the Breast, Arms, Feet, or any other fleshy Part of the Body
          <lb/>the corrupt and pestiferous Matter heing, by the Benefit of
          <lb/>Nature, driven to the external Parts.</p>
        <p rend="indent">A pestilential. Bubo may be known from other Tumors, by
          <lb/>its appearing commonly just at the Time of a Pestilence, and
          <lb/>its being accompanied with other pestilential Signs. For it is
          <lb/>to he consider’d, that the best of our later Writers; who liv’d
          <lb/>in the last pestilential- Times, have assijrdd us, that Persona
          <lb/>seiz’d with the Pestilence, unless they died on the Spot, were
          <lb/>every-where observ'd to have an Eruption of fuch Tumors.
          <lb/>This Eruption happens sometimes quicker, sometimes flower;
          <lb/>for some perceive them before they are sick, or have any Sense
          <lb/>of the pestilentis! Poison ; on others they appear not till the
          <lb/>second, third, or fourth Day after their being seiz'd with the
          <lb/>Contagion ; but they are Very rarely observ'd to come forth
          <lb/>later. Sometimes these Buboes are accompany'd with a Carbuncle.
          <lb/>Or Anthrax, but are more frequently without them ;
          <lb/>whereas a Carbuncle Very seldom happens without a Tumor.
          <lb/>. It is an old Observation, and confirm'd in the last Pestilences,
          <lb/>that most of those on whom Tumors appear'd; if they were
          <lb/>not attended with Very severe Symptoms, or an Accession of
          <lb/>other Disorders, had the good Fortune to recover. Therefore
          <lb/>our later Physicians have come into an Opinion, and not without
          <lb/>Reason, that the principal Part of our Business in managing
          <lb/>the Pestilence consists in promoting, by all imaginable means,
          <lb/>the Growth <hi>os</hi> the Tumor, or Bubo, without the Benefit of
          <lb/>which there is no Preservation of Life under the Pestilence ;
          <lb/>and that the Physician, who takes a right Method of curing the
          <lb/>Bubo, at the same time cures the Pestilence. This being
          <lb/>granted, digesting, dissolving, or repressing Medicines, Phlebotomy,
          <lb/>or Purging, are so far from conducing to the. Cure of
          <lb/>the Pestilence, that, by retracting the Poison into the Blond,
          <lb/>they destroy the Patient. The principal Bufiness therefore of
          <lb/>the Physician, or Surgeon, in this Case, is, to assist provident
          <lb/>Nature, by promoting the Expulsion of the Tumors forming
          <lb/>in the Body, and reducing them as soon as possible to a Suppuration
          <lb/>or Maturity.</p>
        <p rend="indent">For the more ready Accomplishment of this End, it is much
          <lb/>the safest way for the Patient, as foon as he perceives the Eruption
          <lb/>of a Tumor, to confine himself to his House, and avoid the
          <lb/>Air, and even to hetake himself to his Bed; for, by this Method,
          <lb/>he may be the more successfully defended from the external
          <lb/>pestiferous Air, and the Buboes, by the right Administration
          <lb/>both of internal and external Remedies, he the more easily expel'd,
          <lb/>and brought to Suppuration.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As to external Management, it will he extremely proper to
          <lb/>rub the swelling Part, with some Vehemence, both with the
          <lb/>Hands, and with Linen Cloths; ‘ and, what is most effectual to
          <lb/>the Purpose, after that to apply some emollient and maturating
          <lb/>Remedies, to promote a speedy Eruption. A Very good Remedy,
          <lb/>in particular, is a Malagma compos'd of Ferment of
          <lb/>Bread hot, alone, or mix’d with Salt and Mustard-seed bruis'd.
          <lb/>By Virtue of this Medicine the constricted Parts are wonderfully
          <lb/>mollisy'd and stimulated, till the pestiferous Matter, being attracted
          <lb/>from the Blond toward the intumescent Parts, pastes
          <lb/>into a Suppuration. Of the same Virtue are Cataplasms, suppurative
          <lb/>of other Tumors; especially one compos’d of Onions,;
          <lb/>roasted under the Ashes, and work’d with Treacle and Butter ;
          <lb/>or a Cataplasm prepar'd of the Inside of a wheaten or white
          <lb/>.Loaf, and well boil’d with Milk and Saffron. There are some
          <lb/>Surgeons, who, to avoid exposing the Body to the Air, because
          <lb/>of the frequent Change of Cataplasms, by which Transpiration
          <lb/>may he disturb'd or hinder'd, are rather for applying emollient
          <lb/>Planters, particularly a Plaister of Diachylum, simple or Compound,
          <lb/>instead of Cataplasms.</p>
        <p><hi>. Darhettd</hi>, a very noted Physician,-in his Book of the Pedin
          <lb/>lence, prescribes the following, which seems a Very good one.</p>
        <p>Take Plaister of Diachylum and de Mucilaginibuai each half
          <lb/>. a Pound;: Mustard-seed pulveriz'd, four Ounces;. Unguentum
          <lb/>Basilicum, four Ounces :- Mix them, and make
          <lb/>them into a Plaister. This must he laid -upon the swelling</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Part, which must first he well rubb’d, and renews every
          <lb/>Day, or every other Day. .si:..’ ~ ..... ,</p>

        <p>i <hi>Hodges</hi>, a famousEvestessi Physician, in the Description of
          <lb/>that terrible Plague which rag'd at <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1665.
          <lb/>very much commends the following.</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Take Plaister of Oxycroceum, three Ounces; Gum Galbanum
          <lb/>strain’d, and Caranna, each one Ouncecommon
          <lb/>Pitch, two Drams. With Oil of Chamomile melt and
          <lb/>make them into a Plaister according to Art, which must be
          <lb/>applied in the same Method as the former.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Nor does that Plaister deserve to be despis'd, which consists'
          <lb/>os Honey, Meal, and Yolks of Eggs. The Remedies winch
          <lb/>most of the antient Physicians us'd to accelerate Suppuration,
          <lb/>aS Vesicatories of Cantharides, and dry Cuppings, are almost
          <lb/>wholly rejected by the Moderns, and those the most experienc'd
          <lb/>Physicians in during the Pestilence.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But whet is much to be admir'd, and deserves a deeper Consideration,
          <lb/>is, that the Very celebrated <hi>Blent ema</hi>. Physician to
          <lb/>the Emperor, in his <hi>Latin</hi> Treatise of the last Pestilence, as.
          <lb/>sures us that pestilential Buboes were often safely and successfully
          <lb/>resolv'd and cur’d by the bare imposition of hot Ashes.
          <lb/>But tho'there, he hardly any besides this Author, whe advises
          <lb/>the Resolution or Cure of Buboes in a Pestilencessit will not he
          <lb/>amiss here to observe, that the pestiferous Venom was not, by
          <lb/>the Resolution, repressed and repelled into the Blood , but rather
          <lb/>extracted out of the Body<hi rend="sup">X</hi> by means of the hot Ashes, and
          <lb/>quite subdu’d. . ...~ 'sc-.se</p>
        <p rend="indent">To these external Medicines it will be proper to add the Use
          <lb/>of internal Remedies, by whose Assistance the latent Venom
          <lb/>may he expel’d by gentle Sweat; but immoderately heating and
          <lb/>Vehement Sudorifics have heen always found to be noxious and
          <lb/>dangerous, by Physicians of later Times ; whereas supping of
          <lb/>small Liquors het has heen experienc'd to have a Very good
          <lb/>Effect, as heing excellently accommodated to excite a gentie
          <lb/>Sweat, and to temper the Blood. Medicines of this Nature,
          <lb/>among others, are Potions of Tea, min’d with a little Saffron,
          <lb/>or of other alexipharmic Herbs, as Sage, Scordium, Rue, Millefolium,
          <lb/>or Betony ; Ptisan also, prepar’d with, or without,
          <lb/>the Root Of Scorzonera, and drank hot, in order to maintain a
          <lb/>Continual, but gentie Sweat. And as Vchernent Sudorifics, so
          <lb/>cold Liquors are not a little dangerous; for they not only repress
          <lb/>the Sweat, but, in a remarkable manner, restrain the Eruption
          <lb/>and Growth of the Buboes, on whose kindly Promotion and
          <lb/>Increase the Fate <hi>of</hi> the Patient so much depends. The Ain of
          <lb/>the Chamher in which the Patient lies, must be kept in a temperate
          <lb/>State, neither too het, nor too cold; the Bed also must he
          <lb/>kept in the same Temperament, and as commodious aS possible.
          <lb/>If the Patient be weak and low, but without any remarkable
          <lb/>Degree of Heat, it will, not be improper to give thirty or forty
          <lb/>Drops Of Elixir Proprietatis, or the Mixtura Simplex, the Bezoartic
          <lb/>Tincture, Essence of Myrrh, Essence of Scordium,
          <lb/>two or three times every Day, in some warm Liquor ; or exhibit
          <lb/>some good Bezoartic Powder. On the contrary, for thefe
          <lb/>who are os a hot Complexion, or are molested with immoderate
          <lb/>Heat, nothing is more proper than Nitre depurated, with Crabseyes,
          <lb/>and testaceous Powders, or temperate Acids, such as the
          <lb/>Juices of Citrons, Currants, and Pomegranates, or the Syrup
          <lb/>and Water of Borage, Bugloss, or any Other temperate and
          <lb/>cooling Simple, often exhibited, instilling at the same time,
          <lb/>if the Heat be Vehement, some Drops of sweet Spirit Of
          <lb/>Vitriol</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Remedies above prescrib'd are of sufficient Virtue to expel
          <lb/>all the Poison of the Contagion from the inward and noble Parts,
          <lb/>on the Authority ofthe most learned and experienc'd Physicians,
          <lb/>who have written on the late Pestilence in <hi>Poland, Prussia, Den.,
          <lb/>mark, Austria, Hungary, and Ratiston</hi>. These, then, are to
          <lb/>be frequentiy repeated, till either the Tumors are digested and
          <lb/>resolved, which, they tell us, sometimes happens without Suppuration,
          <lb/>or, what more generally happens, are brought to
          <lb/>Maturation." in some Cases the Tumor immediately inclines
          <lb/>to Suppuration, sometimes it remains for whole Weeks, without
          <lb/>being in the least mollisy'd. When this happens, the Use
          <lb/>of the above-prescrib'd Medicines is to be continu'd till the Tumor
          <lb/>either breaks of itself, or is open'd with the Incision-knife ;
          <lb/>and the pestiferous Matter, heing thereby prohibited from returning
          <lb/>into the Blond, is evacuated, and the Wound thoroughly
          <lb/>cleans'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Abscess being open'd, we must immediately set about
          <lb/>cleansing it, which being completed, the Wound must be
          <lb/>heal'd by means of some Vulnerary Balsam. For the Purpose of </p>
        <pb n="74"/>
        <p rend="indent">cleansing, we have a most noble Remedy, which is, the digestive
          <lb/>Ointment, (Tnrpentinewith the Yolk of an 'Egg) mix'd with
          <lb/>. a small Quantity of <hi>Fenice</hi> Treacle, and Balsam os Sulphur with</p>
        <p rend="indent">Oil ofTurpentine. At every Dressing the Pus is to he gently absterged

          <lb/>he too narrow; and a Plainer-must he laid thereon , and the
          <lb/>Place carefully bound up. Some of the best Plaisters in this Case
          <lb/>are Diachylon, or whet is compos’d of Meal and Honey, and
          <lb/>these may Very properly be apply'd till the Wound is heal’d,</p>
        <p rend="indent">As to the most convenient Time for making, the Incision,
          <lb/>Physicians are not agreed. Many Authors, especially' among
          <lb/>the Moderns, who have given us Precepts concerning the PestiIence,
          <lb/>are utterly against opening a pestilential Bubo till it he
          <lb/>perfectly ripe, and thoroughly Jost. For, beside that these
          <lb/>Buboes, as some have observ’d, almost constantly break os themselves,
          <lb/>there is Very great Danger,' is we may believe these Aushots,
          <lb/>lest a too hasty and precipitate Incision of a Bubo should
          <lb/>he succeeded by a Fistula of a bad kind, by an Immobility of
          <lb/>the Limbs, and even by a Gangrene. Others, on the contrary,
          <lb/>affert that the. immediate incision of a pestilential Bubo in the

        <p rend="indent">Venereal Buboes are painful, hard, renitent Tumors ofsthe
          <lb/>Conglobate or Lymphatic Glands, which are situated in the
          <lb/>Groins, and which tend flowly to Suppuration, arising mediately
          <lb/>or immediately from impure' Venereal Commerce. ‘ Therefore
          <lb/>when this Species off the Venereal Disease affects either
          <lb/>Male or Female immediately after inmure Embraces, or in a sew
          <lb/>Days after, some or more Glands,-in either or both Groins, give
          <lb/>some flight Pain in walking ; and, upon seeling them, it may
          <lb/>he perceived, that they are somewhat turnery’d. . The Tumor
          <lb/>increases faster or flower, and grows herd, tense, and renitent ;
          <lb/>hence the Pain imthe Part increases, a Sensation of preternatural
          <lb/>Heat is perceiv’d, but the Skin still retains its natural Colour;
          <lb/>the Patient finds more Difficulty in walking; at length a manifest
          <lb/>Bubo appears, which are different in Figure, as orbicular,
          <lb/>oblong, or round ; sometimes of the Size of a Pigeon's Or Hen's
          <lb/>Egg, sometimes as large as a Man's Fist.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Venereal Buboes admit of a threefold Distinction. I. They

          <lb/>Embraces, and Constitute <hi>2D. essential</hi> Disease; others accompany
          <lb/>a Gonorrhea which is suddenly suppress'd, or has but a small Discharge
          <lb/>; or esse attend chancrous Ulcers of the Penis, and form
          <lb/>a<hi>fymptomaiieal</hi> Disease; lastly, others arise spontaneoufly without

        <p rend="indent">2. They may be distinguish'd hy their Qualities ; for some
          <lb/>are attended with great Pain, Heat, and Pulsation, and are of
          <lb/>the Phlegmon kind; others have but little Heat, Pain, Pulsation,
          <lb/>and Hardness, but are rather soft, and retain the Marks
          <lb/>. of the Fingers after Pressure, and are of the oedematous kind ;
          <lb/>lastly, others being quite Void of Pain, Heat, and Puliation,
          <lb/>are Very hard, and are call'd <hi>scirrhous</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">3. They may he distinguish'd by their manner of terminating,
          <lb/>which is Various ; for some, either spontaneoufly, or by the
          <lb/>Force of the Remedies applied to them, are dispersed by Demees,
          <lb/>and disappear ; others come to Suppuration, and, after
          <lb/>-Evacuation of the Pus which was collected in them, at an
          <lb/>Aperture made by a Caustic or Incision, form a Cicatrix; lash.

        <p rend="indent">The inguinal Glands cannot he tumefy'd after impure Embraces,
          <lb/>and indurated into a Bubo, unless the Lymph, which
          <lb/>is convey'd to them from the neighbouring Parts, as to
          <lb/>a common Reservoir, and ought to flow thro’ these Celis or
          <lb/>Vesicles, in order to be carried off again, stagnate there, and
          <lb/>be accumulated in them. But the Lymph cannot stagnate, and
          <lb/>he accumulated in the inguinal Glands, unless it he thicker, ant
          <lb/>more Viscid than usual. It follows, therefore, that the Lymph,
          <lb/>which circulates thro' the inguinal Glands, is render'd tot</p>
        <p>thick and Viscid by impure-Embraces,' and, by heing aectiniulured

        <p rend="indent">But nothing new happens to the Body from impure Embraces;

          <lb/>Infection, therefore, heing admitted into the Body, and blended
          <lb/>with the Lymph of the inguinal Glands, renders it too Viscid

        <p rend="indent">The. infectious Matter, when once receiv'd, can he conimtinicated

          <lb/>Matter, penetrating the Pores of the Parts, will insinuate itself
          <lb/>into the Lymph which flows thro' them, but this Lymph continually
          <lb/>flows from thence to the inguinal Glands. Therefore
          <lb/>the Venereal Matter, which is mix'd with the Lymph, tends to
          <lb/>the fame Parts;</p>
        <p>In a suppressed Gonorrhea, or a Gonorrhea where the Discharge
          <lb/>is too small, the seminary Vesicles, Cowper's Glands,
          <lb/>and Testes, in Men, but, in Women, the Prostates, Cowper's

          <lb/></p>
        <p rend="indent">After the same manner the Lymph which returns from'the
          <lb/>Pudenda in either Sex, when they are affected with chancrous

          <lb/>will produce Buboes, if the Infection has Virulency enough to
          <lb/>produce such an Effect But let the Bubo arise from whatever
          <lb/>Cause, either from impure Embraces, a suppressed Gonorrhea,
          <lb/>chancrous Ulcers, or, lastly, fromia latent Pox, if it happens,

        <p rend="indent">This Disparity may arise from three Causes.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I.  From the Disorder of the Part from whence the Poison

        <p>2.  From the Disorder of the particular Part, to which the

          <lb/><hi rend="sup">t</hi> 2. The Glands of the Groin cannot swell, without heing
          <lb/>upon the Stretch ; nor can they suffer Distention .without
          <lb/>Pain, more or less, according to the:Degree' of the Tuniori
          <lb/>Hence, therefore, upon .the Increase of the Bubo, Pain will
          <lb/>arise in the inguinal Glands., '</p>
        <p rend="indent">3; It is impossible to walk, unless the Muscles of the' Leg
          <lb/>and Thigh pull them forward ; but .these Muscles cannot ahi
          <lb/>without pressing upon she tumefy Ἀ Glands of the Groin, and,
          <lb/>by this Pressure, Pain will be excited. The Action of Walking,
          <lb/>therefore, cannot be perform’d without raising Pain in the
          <lb/>Venereal Bubo.</p>
        <p rend="indent">4. The Glands of the Groin, being once obstnicied, will
          <lb/>dally be more and more fwell’d by the continual Accession of
          <lb/>fresh Lymph, till, at last, the-Force with which the Glands
          <lb/>resist farther Dilatation, will be equal to the Force with which
          <lb/>the fresh Lymph is impel’d. Therefore the Bubo will dally
          <lb/>Increase, grow harder, and, becoming prominent, tend to a
          <lb/>Point, 5 extending itself obliquely, according to the Situation of
          <lb/>the inguinal Glands; more or less, however, in proportion to
          <lb/>the Magnitude and Extensibility of these Glands, and the different
          <lb/>Impulse of the Lymphi which arrives at the Pars.</p>
        <p rend="indent">5. Upon the Increase of the Bubo, the Blood-vessels which
          <lb/>creep thro’ the Middle of the Substance of the indurated Gland,
          <lb/>must necessarily be compressed. But the'Bloed which stows
          <lb/>thro’ thefe compressed Vessels, must 'stagnate and he retarded
          <lb/>. in them, and, by that means, increafe the Heat of the Part,
          <lb/>till it has found itself a Passage. Hence, therefore, the Heat
          <lb/>of the Bubo will increase.</p>
        <p rend="indent">6. But if the Tumor of the Gland increases exceedingly fast,
          <lb/>and suddenly restrains the Course of the Blood ; if the Pulsation
          <lb/>of the Arteries is very strong, from the natural Make of the
          <lb/>Body, or from a Fever coming on ; lastly. If the Blood, being
          <lb/>naturally-hot, rarefies much; several sinall Drops of Blood will
          <lb/>force their Way into the lateral Lymphatic Vessels, from whence
          <lb/>a new Circulation of the Blood, deviating from its Course,
          <lb/>being begun, the Bubo will increase in Heat, Pain, Puliation,
          <lb/>’ and Resistance; in a Word, will become a true Phlegmon.</p>
        <p rend="indent">7.  But because the Blood-vessels of the Skin, which is free
          <lb/>from any Disorder, are not at all, or very little, streighten’d, the
          <lb/>Blood flows there as usual, and the Skin is not at all inflamed,
          <lb/>and scarcely changes its Colour, but preserves that which is riatural
          <lb/>to it, or assumes one'very little different from it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">8. If the. Tumor increases stowly, if the Pulsation of the
          <lb/>Arteries is flow and weak, if the Blood of the Panent is naturally
          <lb/>aqueous, and inclin’d to Diflolution, the Blood will'be
          <lb/>driven languidly and slowly into the Vesseis of the obstructsd
          <lb/>Gland, and in them it will flow still flower, and therefore
          <lb/>will he less restrain’d ; it will not stagnate, therefore, or will
          <lb/>stagnate very little, in the neighbouring Vessels; and therefore
          <lb/>will bring on hut a moderate Degree of Heat and Pain, and a
          <lb/>weak Pulsation of the Arteries ; but it will, by Degrees, so dilate
          <lb/>the Pasiages theo’which it passes, that the Streightness which
          <lb/>was brought on upon the external Parts, will give very little
          <lb/>Trouble ; or it will open itself a new Passage into the intend
          <lb/>Vesseis, leaving only its thinner Serous or lymphatic Parts
          <lb/>with which it abounds, in the Substance of the Humour.
          <lb/>Hence therefore th<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Bubo in rhe inguinal - Glands will be
          <lb/>attended with moderate Heat, Pain, and Pulsation; and,
          <lb/>being soft, at least externally, will easily receive and retain the
          <lb/>Erint of the Finger upon Pressure; ina Word, it will become
          <lb/>oedernatous.</p>
        <p rend="indent">9.  Lastly, if the Blond is more thick, and inclin’d to Dryness,
          <lb/>and secretes a thick and less fluid Lymph; if thet Lymph
          <lb/>is collected very stowly in the inguinal Glands, the Bubo which
          <lb/>arises from thence will be scirrhous, that, is, hard and renitent,

        <p rend="indent">Venereal Buboes agree with simple, pestilential, scorbutic,
          <lb/>and strumous Buboes, with respects to their Situation and Figure
          <lb/>; bur are distinguishable frorn them by peculiar Marks;
          <lb/>I." From simple and pestilential Buboes, , because in these the
          <lb/>Skin is red and inflamed, different from what it is in the Venereal
          <lb/>Bubo. 2. From strumous and scothutical, because from
          <lb/>the known State of the Patient manifest Signs of strumous or
          <lb/>scorbutical Disorders are collested. 3. But they are most certainly
          <lb/>distinguished from all others by the Relation of the Patrents,
          <lb/>who confess, that they have been guilty of unclean or
          <lb/>suspeoled Venery ; or that they are affectid with a Gonorrhea,
          <lb/>orchencrous Ulcers..’:</p>
        <p rend="indent">Venereal Buboes bear no very small Resemblance to the Bubonocele,
          <lb/>or inguinal Hernia ; yet we have known them fornetimes
          <lb/>confounded with it, not with that kind of Bubonocele
          <lb/>which is occasioned by the falling down of the Omentum,
          <lb/>and is called Epsploccle, in which the Tumor is foster, but
          <lb/>with that which is occasioned by the Intestine, and is called
          <lb/>Enterocele, in which there is: greater Resistance, and is for
          <lb/>thet Reason more like a Bubo ; but it cannot readily be mistaken
          <lb/>for thet Species os Enterocele, in which the Intestine
          <lb/>slips through the oblique Rings of the Epigastric Muscles, hecause
          <lb/>the Place in which the intestine falis down, and where
          <lb/>the Tumor is raised, is at a Distance from the Inguinal Glands,
          <lb/>and of Consequence <hi>from</hi> the Venereal Bubo ; but it may be
          <lb/>confounded with that Enterocele, in which the intestine, falls
          <lb/>.into the Groin through the Foramen in the Peritonaeum,
          <lb/>through which the crural Vessels pass, which in them Situation
          <lb/>differ not much from that of the Inguinal Glands, or Buboes.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But a Bubo may be easily distinguished from an Enterocele
          <lb/>Of any kind, by the following Signs. ... ......</p>
        <p rend="indent">I. In the Enterocele the Tumor is smooth upon the Super.
          <lb/>sicies, and pretty nearly of a spherical Figure ; the Superficies
          <lb/>is pretty broad, but the Basis stender, equal to the Sine of the
          <lb/>Foramen, from whence the Intestine is fallen, and adheres to
          <lb/>the Groin, as it were by a Stalk: the Bubo, on the other
          <lb/>Hand, has an unequal Superficies, and is generally of an. ohlong
          <lb/>Figure, and has a wide expanded Basis.</p>
        <p rend="indent">2. In the Enterocele the Tumor easily yields upon Pressure,
          <lb/>but, upon taking off the Finger, it instantly recovers itself:
          <lb/>on the contrary, the Bubo resists Pressure, as the Bubo of the
          <lb/>Phiegnlon and scirrhous kind; or, if it yields to Pressure, it re- </p>
        <pb n="76"/>
        <p rend="indent">tains the Print of the Body impressed upon it, as the oedemamatous'and
          <lb/>suppurated Bubo.</p>
        <p rend="indent">3. In the Enterocele it appears by Its giving Way to Pressure,
          <lb/>and easily rising again, that either Flatuses alone, or
          <lb/>.'mixed with a liquid Matter, are the Contents of the Tumor:
          <lb/>But in the Bubo no Flatulency is to he discover'd; or if by any
          <lb/>' obscure Fluctuation it shall be discover'd, that any Fluid is
          <lb/>contained therein, it is but in a very small Quantity, and lies
          <lb/>deep, and is'only contained in the Middle of the Tumor, as
          <lb/>it happens in the suppurated Bubo.</p>
        <p rend="indent">4. The Enterocele brings on Very had Symptoms, as Fever,
          <lb/>colical Pains, total Astrictions of the Bowels, Vomiting of the
          <lb/>intestinal Feces upwards, and Iliac Passion, which never attend
          <lb/>the Bubo. Besides, it is an exceedingly rare Thing, that
          <lb/>the Use of impure or suspected Venery, by which the Bubo
          <lb/>is produced, shall so aptly coincide with a Fall from on high,
          <lb/>a Blow, upon the Belly, or Violent Motion, by which the
          <lb/>Enterocele is brought on, that it shall make it a Doubt of
          <lb/>which kind theTumor of the Groin is, and to which Cause
          <lb/>it ought to be ascribed. ' '<space type="tab"> </space>si</p>

        <p rend="indent"><orth>AS</orth> soon as eVer it appears, that there is a Venereal Bubo,
          <lb/>it is easy enough to find out the Differences by which it is distinguish'd,
          <lb/>by the Signa which we have laid down in its Description.
          <lb/>For if theTumor is intensely hot, painful, has a
          <lb/>Pulsation in it, and resists pressure, it is a Bubo of the Phlegmon
          <lb/>kind ; but . if the Heat, .Pain, Pulsation, and Resistance
          <lb/>are in a moderate Degree, or if it is os a softer Nature, and
          <lb/>‘ retains the Print of the Finger impressed upon it, it is cedematous
          <lb/>; lastly, if it is hard, makes great Resistance to Pressure,
          <lb/>is quite free from Heat, Pain, or Pulsation, it is manifest,
          <lb/>that it is a Bubo of the scirrhous kind.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Lastly, The Causes' of Venereal Buboes are to he inquir’d
          <lb/>into, either from the Relation of the Patient, or from the
          <lb/>Knowledge os what has preceded ; from whence it will appeas,
          <lb/>whether the Venereal Infection was communicated to
          <lb/>the Inguinal Glands immediately by impure Coition, or by
          <lb/>the Suppression of a Gonorrhea, or by chancrons Ulcers of
          <lb/>the Penis, or from a latent Pox.*</p>
        <p rend="indent">As to the Prognostics, the Venereal Bubo, if it is treated
          <lb/>with Caution, is attended with tho Danger ; it is, however, a
          <lb/>Very troublesome Disorder, since it always requires a tedious
          <lb/>Method of Cure, and oftentimes a Chisurgical Operation.</p>
        <p rend="indent">A Bubo may nevertheless be accounted dangerous on this
          <lb/>Account, that it frequentiy brings on the Pox, unless the
          <lb/>Poison’ that it receives is evacuated by Suppuration, or repeated
          <lb/>Purging, and the Relicts, if any such should remain in the
          <lb/>Blood, are diligently corrected by specific Remedies. But
          <lb/>there is less Danger of the Ροχ to be apprchended from the
          <lb/>Bubo which' arises from impure Embraces, or from a suppressed
          <lb/>Gonorrhea, or from Ulcers of the Penis, than from
          <lb/>rhe Bubo which arises without any present manifest Couse ;
          <lb/>for the first arises from the Infection, which is just admitted,
          <lb/>and which, as it has not been communicated to the Blood,
          <lb/>may be discharg'd or cojrected ; but the latter depends upon
          <lb/>the Infection which has been already conceal’d a long time in
          <lb/>the Blood, and therefore has throughly tainted it.</p>
        <p rend="hanging">The Bubo of the Phegmon kind admits of a much more
          <lb/>easy Cure, than that os the cedematous, or of the scirrhous
          <lb/>kind , for aS the first may be easily resolv'd, or brought to
          <lb/>Suppuration, it in either way, by observing proper Cautions,
          <lb/>quickly admits of a perfect Cure: but the latter frequentiy
          <lb/>ends in a truly scirrhous Tumor, which for a considerable time
          <lb/>eludes the Force os all Remedies, and at length frequentiy degenerates
          <lb/>into a cancerous Nature.</p>

        <p><orth>CURE</orth>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Cure of the Venereal Bubo may he undertook in three
          <lb/>.Cases. I. Ise it has come on without any manifest Cause.</p>
        <p rend="indent">2. If it is accompanied with a virulent Gonorrhea, or chancrous
          <lb/>Ulcers of the Penis. 3. If it is unattended with any
          <lb/>other Disorder, and arises immediately after impure Embraces.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the first Case, when the Bubo is an Evidence ofi a latent
          <lb/>Pox, it is proper without Delay to heVe recourse to Mercurial
          <lb/>Unction, by which both the Bubo, and the Pox, by
          <lb/>which it is occasion’d, may he perfectly cured. But, if the
          <lb/>Patient cannot, or will nos, make use of this salutary Advice,
          <lb/>you may try other specific Remedies, according to the Methods
          <lb/>laid down- below, cautioning the Patient, as it is the
          <lb/>Duty of every ingenuous Physician, that by this Method the
          <lb/>Disease will not have a complete, hut a palliative Cure
          <lb/>only.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the second Case, the same Remedies in like manner are
          <lb/>to be applied aster the same Methods, but joined with others
          <lb/>which may be proper for rhe Gonorrhea or Ulcers, in such a
          <lb/>.manner, that by the Joint Force of the Remedies both Dis.
          <lb/>orders may be perfectly cured at the same time.</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Lastly, in the third Cafe, (which, as it is the most simple,
          <lb/>may be a Rule sor the rest) the utmost Endeavours should he
          <lb/>used to destroy or discharge the Infection which is just admitted;
          <lb/>and, is any Relidfe remain in the Bloed- which may</p>
        <p>renew or bring on the Pox, they should be diligently corrected.
          <lb/></p>
        <p>Custom has established two Methods, by which all these
          <lb/>Effects are equally produced ; one by which Venereal Buboes
          <lb/>are cured without Suppuration, or any Application of ripening
          <lb/>Medicines, that is, only by the Use of Mercurials and
          <lb/>Cathartics, till the Tumor, being dispersed, disappears by Degrees.
          <lb/></p>
        <p>The other consists in curing Buboes hy Suppuration, which
          <lb/>is promoted by the Application of ripening Topics to the Part,
          <lb/>and is so united with the internal Use os Mercurials, that the
          <lb/>morbid Infection is by both destroyed.</p>
        <p>The first Method requires no Operation to he perform'd, is
          <lb/>shorter, free from Pain, -and equally safe, and therefore, in
          <lb/>the Judgment of many, seems preferable to the other. But
          <lb/>at the same time it has this inconvenience, that the Patient must
          <lb/>he confin'd to his Chamber, during the whole Time of the
          <lb/>Cure, if he would avoid the Danger he may incur from the
          <lb/>Coldness of the Air. The later Method generally takes up
          <lb/>more Time, is Very tedious, and, as it requires the Performance
          <lb/>of an Operation, is painful; but, as it generally permits the
          <lb/>Patient to follow his usual Business, it is not yet quite neglected;
          <lb/>but sometimes things come to that Height of themselves,
          <lb/>when the Suppuration is once begun, that the Physician is obliged
          <lb/>to follow this Method, though it be ever so much against
          <lb/>his Will. Therefore, lest I should seem guilty of an Omission,
          <lb/>I shall defcrihe both Methods, but as briefly aS I can.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I. Therefore first according to the former Method.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I.  In the Beginning vou should bleed, that the Glands may
          <lb/>be unloaded, and the inflammation of them prevented. Tho
          <lb/>Blood should he drawn freely, if the Bubo is of the Phlegmon
          <lb/>kind; but Very sparingly, tf it is cedematous, or scirrhous.
          <lb/>Therefore the Practice of the old Authors is not to he regarded
          <lb/>in this Cafe, who, led by Prejudice, which Experience proves
          <lb/>to be false, were afraid os opening a Vein in curing a Bubo,
          <lb/>as if the Infection would by this means be thrown into the
          <lb/>Blood, and produce a Pox.</p>
        <p rend="indent">2.  After this, the Patient should he purged, hath that the
          <lb/>Way may be prepared for the Use of other Remedies and that
          <lb/>Part of the infectious Matter may he carried off * Mild and
          <lb/>Cooling Purges should he Prescribed, if the Bubo is attended
          <lb/>with Inflammation. These may consist of the Pulp of <hi>Cassia,</hi>
          <lb/>Decoction of Tamarinds, some purgative Salt, with a moderate
          <lb/>Dose of <hi>Mcrcurius Dulcis</hi>, or <hi>Calomel</hi>. Proper Formulae of

          <lb/>up with a proper Quantity of Conserve of Roses.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But stronger Purges should he Order'd, if the Bubo should
          <lb/>he cedematous or scirrhous. These may consist of Jalap,
          <lb/>Diagrydium, large Doses of Calomel, adding also, if necessary,
          <lb/>the <hi>Trochisci alhandal</hi>. Proper Formulae for answering

        <p rend="hanging">Take of Calomel, twenty Grains; of Jalap, and sulphurated

          <lb/>be carried downwards, which otherwise would be discharged by
          <lb/>the Salival Glands. That this may succeed the better, you
          <lb/>must entirely abstain for some time from the Use of Mercurials,
          <lb/>and rest till all is quiet again ; if it shall seem proper, the
          <lb/>Purging should he frequently repeated, that the Salivation may

        <p rend="indent">6.  Emollient and resolving Topics conduce much to this

          <lb/>other Day, or every third Day, aS it shall seem requisite,
          <lb/>or as the Danger os a Ptyalism is greater or less. For by this
          <lb/>means the Lymph, which from its Thickness stagnates in the
          <lb/>Inguinal Glands, is render'd more fluid, and is therefore more
          <lb/>easily dispersed.</p>
        <p rend="indent">7.  It has been the Practice for forne time, to lay aside the

        <p rend="indent">2.  Then, during the whole Course of Cure, mercurial Preparations
          <lb/>should be order'd, which aro free from any purging

        <p rend="hanging">Take two Ounces of Onions roasted under the Ashes, of

          <lb/>is found in the Bubo, yet you are not too hastily to open this
          <lb/>Buhe, but should wait for some time, till the greatest Part os
          <lb/>the Buhe is suppurated, that by this means the callous Parts of
          <lb/>the Buhe being destroy'd, the Cure may be perfected with the

        <p rend="indent">6.  The suppurated Bubo may he laid Open two different
          <lb/>ways, either with an Incifion-knise, Or by the potential Cautery

        <p rend="indent">7.  It is plain, that, in laying open a Bubo, the Ufe of the
          <lb/>Caustic is preferable to Incision, both because the Caustic makes
          <lb/>a larger Opening, by which means it is easier to inspect and

          <lb/>‘the Caustic, hyssts Catharetic Faculty, destroys the callous

        <p rend="indent">From what has heen said, it will he juo hard Talk to solve
          <lb/>the following Problems :</p>
        <p rend="indent">I.  Whether Venereal Buboes arise in any other Parts besides
          <lb/>the Groin Γ</p>
        <p rend="indent">It appears by Experience, that Venereal Buboes, or Tumors
          <lb/>os the same Kind, sometimes appear in the Axillae, the
          <lb/>Throat, or upon the Sides of the lower Jaw, which are Very
          <lb/>like the Inguinal Buboes, come on in the same manner, take,
          <lb/>the same Course, and are cured by the same Remedies.</p>
        <p rend="indent">2.  From what Cause should Venereal Buboes arise in those
          <lb/>Parts?</p>
        <p rend="indent">From a twofold Cause, as we just now said of the Inguinal
          <lb/>Buboes: (i). From an old Venereal Insection, which in the
          <lb/>Pox insects and inspissates the Lymph ; by winch means there
          <lb/>will be an easy Descent upon these Glands, whenever the
          <lb/>external Cold, a Blow, Attrition, or strong Pressure, shall
          <lb/>afford an Occasion. f2). From the Venereal Insection just
          <lb/>admitted, which being absorbed in certain Parts, is carried
          <lb/>with the refluent Lymph into the Glands, to which thet Lymph
          <lb/>is determined by the Laws of the Circulation.. So Nurses who
          <lb/>are infected by the Infants which they suckle, have most frequentiy
          <lb/>Buboes either in the conglobate Glands, which are situated
          <lb/>at the Basis of, their Breasts, to which the Lymph fust
          <lb/>flows; or else in the Axillary Glands, to which it is afterwards
          <lb/>carried. So Children which receive the Infection from their
          <lb/>Nurses, or the Lover who receives it from his Mistress, or the
          <lb/>Mistress from her Lover, by kissing, are subject to Buboes in
          <lb/>the Maxillary or Jugular Glands ; whence the Lymph is conveyed
          <lb/>that returns from the Tongue, Cheeks, and Gums, and
          <lb/>from the internal Parts of the Mouth, into winch the fust Particles
          <lb/>of Infection penetrate, blended with Milk or Saliva.
          <lb/>‘ 3. How are these Buboes cured ?</p>
        <p rend="indent">After the fame Method by which the Inguinal Buboes themselves
          <lb/>are cured, since they agree with them in all Points.
          <lb/>Therefore by Bleeding, Purging, and Mercurial Unctions,
          <lb/>they are to he dispersed, if possible ; but if these Methods do.
          <lb/>not answer the defined End, they are to he brought to Suppuration,
          <lb/>laid open, deterged, and cicatrized, according to Art,
          <lb/>as we have advised above.</p>
        <p rend="indent">4.  Do Venereal Buboes ever arise in the internal Lymphatic
          <lb/>Glands ?</p>
        <p rend="indent">I never Observed any Venereal Buboes of this Kind myself,
          <lb/>nor do I remember to have read of any one that ever did observe
          <lb/>them. But it is common enough for hard and scirrhous Tubercles
          <lb/>to he sound in the Lungs of pocky Persons; and hard scirrhous
          <lb/>Obstructions in the Mesenteric Glands, which if they
          <lb/>do not go off in the same manner with Buboes, yet they acknowledge
          <lb/>the same Cause.</p>
        <p rend="indent">5.  Whence arises this Difference, fince, on the Other hand,
          <lb/>in the Pex, the morbific Matter being equally mixed with the
          <lb/>whole Mass of Blood, and in the same manner with all the
          <lb/>Lymph, ought to produce the same Disorder in each of the
          <lb/>Glands ?</p>
        <p rend="indent">Perhaps, from hence ; because as the internal Lymphatic
          <lb/>Glands are situated in Places that abound constantiy with a great
          <lb/>deal of Heat, the native Fluidity of the Lymph is the more
          <lb/>easily preserved in them. Thence a Stagnation of the Lymph
          <lb/>must be an uncommon Cafe in them; and if it should by
          <lb/>chance happen, it will he less, make a flower Progress, and he
          <lb/>more easily dispersed, than in the external Glands, which are
          <lb/>subject to the Coldness of the Air., Besides, the internal Glands
          <lb/>are guarded from Blows, Attrition, and Pressure, by which the
          <lb/>Lymph is frequently invited to stagnate in the external
          <lb/>Glands.</p>
        <p rend="indent">6.  Lastly, whether Venereal Buboes are formed in Catamites
          <lb/>and Pathics; and if they are produced by this <hi rend="u">means</hi>, in what
          <lb/>Parts is it usual for them to appear ?</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>As to</hi> the first Question, I never observed myself, nor did I
          <lb/>ever meet with any one that eVer observed Buboes upon Catamites,
          <lb/>which could certainly he determined to arise from the
          <lb/>Infection just contracted: For I do not imagine, that there are
          <lb/>any Catamites who are so fond of playing thePathic, that they
          <lb/>never attempt to play the Agent ; but it is enough to heve once
          <lb/>played the Virile Part, to make it Matter of doubt whence the
          <lb/>Bubo arises, is it shall follow this Action.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As to the later Question, I scarcely believe, that the Buboes
          <lb/>which are formed in Catamites, if such do ever proceed
          <lb/>from unnatural Venery, sail upon the Inguinal Glands, to
          <lb/>which Parts the Lymph is never carried, or at least in exceeding
          <lb/>small Quantities, from the Extremity of the Rectum, and
          <lb/>the neighbouring Parts os the Anus; but they will rather arise
          <lb/>in those Lymphatic Glands, which are situated ini the Cavity
          <lb/>os the Abdomen, near the Division of the descending Aorta, to
          <lb/>which Glands the Lymph of these Parts is carried: And this,
          <lb/>perhaps, is the Occasion that Buboes of this Kind are never, or
          <lb/>Very rarely, produced ; because as these Glands are situated in
          <lb/>the Cavity os the Abdomen, the Heat of the neighbouring Parts
          <lb/>resists the Inspissation of the Lymph, aS was j<hi rend="u">ust</hi> now Observed,</p>
        <p>But let not these Wretches congratulate themselves upon <hi>this</hi>
          <lb/>Account, fince, besides many Very grievous Disorders, which are
          <lb/>peculiar to their filthy Vice, they are intitled to Buboes of aS
          <lb/>bad, if not of a worse Kind, than inguinal Buboes ; <hi>for</hi> it frequentiy
          <lb/>happens in them, that the Lymph, winch returns from
          <lb/>the Extremity of the Rectum, and the Pans near the Anus,
          <lb/>heing inspissated by poisonous Panicles, enlarges, distends, and
          <lb/>swells the Lymphatic Glands, which are Very <hi rend="u">fmall</hi>, but situated
          <lb/>in great Numbers in the Fat about the Podex; whence arises at
          <lb/>kind of an annular Bubo, with which the Podex is incircled,
          <lb/>attended with Heat, Redness, Hardness, and excessive Pain,
          <lb/>especially at the Time of the Excretion of the Foeces. This is
          <lb/>to he cured with the same Remedies, and treated aster the'
          <lb/>same manner, with the Inguinal Venereal Buboes.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thus sor Mr. <hi>Astruc</hi>. But with respect to the Cure os Venereal
          <lb/>Buboes, I must remark, that the: Method of Cure by
          <lb/>Suppuration is preferable on all Accounts to that by Resolution
          <lb/>for the former is much less Trouble to the Patiens, supposing
          <lb/>the Cure by both Methods to he perfected ; and not by far so
          <lb/>subject to he followed by other Venereal Symptoms, and those
          <lb/>of the Very worst Kind, which I have seldom fail'd to see consequent
          <lb/>to the Resolution of a Venereal Bubo.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Histor, I am sensible, is of a different Opinion ; hut I am
          <lb/>inclined to believe, thet the general Practice of those most concern'd
          <lb/>in Venereal Cases will determine it against him. I hesieve,
          <lb/>however, that it is possible to cure a Venereal Bubo by
          <lb/>Resolution ; but with less Ease and Safety. But as <hi>Heister</hi> is an..
          <lb/>Author of Reputation, I shall specify the particular Method of
          <lb/>Cure, which he recommends, as follows.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As to the Cure, there are many Physicians who will not admit
          <lb/>of resolving this any. more than a pestilential Bubo ; for by
          <lb/>such a Method the Venereal Venom, contrary to the Intention,
          <lb/>of Nature, would return into the Veins, and, by infecting the
          <lb/>Blood, excite a Lues Venerea. For the same Reason they <hi>for..</hi>
          <lb/>bid the Use of Cathartics and Phlebotomy ; and direct a Suppuration
          <lb/>to be forwarded as much aS possible. But, sor my part,
          <lb/>though with due Respect to these Authors, I am for a different
          <lb/>Way of Proceeding ; for fince the Method by Suppuration is
          <lb/>not only very flow and tedious, but subjected to several other
          <lb/>InconVeniencies, it is much the hetter and safer Way, as I heve
          <lb/>often found by Experience, to begin immediately.with Purging,
          <lb/>and other Mercurial Medicines, and Purifiers os the Blond, fuch
          <lb/>as Decoctions of the Woods, and other things os the like Nature.
          <lb/>By these means the Venom is expefl'd by a far more
          <lb/>expeditious Way than by the Method of Suppuration ; and the
          <lb/>Tumors themselves may also he resolv'd without Fear or Danger
          <lb/>of the Lues Venerea, or any other Distemper.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Whether, therefore, the Buboes he attended with a Gonorrhoea,
          <lb/>or not, the most proper Way,' certainly, is to purge
          <lb/>the Patient with large and frequent Doses of Mercurius dulcis,
          <lb/>as is usual in a Gonorrhoea; sor the internal Cure of a Gonorrhoea
          <lb/>is usually the Cure of the Buboes, which can never he
          <lb/>perfectly healed hefore the Venereal Poison be quite expelled
          <lb/>from the Body. If there he a considerable Inflammation, it will
          <lb/>he necestary, especially if the Patient he young, and os a sanguine
          <lb/>Constitution, to take away some Blood, and afterwards
          <lb/>administer some mercurial Cathartics, with Essences that purity
          <lb/>the Blond, and Decoctions of the Woods. Outwardly, to the
          <lb/>Tumor, must he apply'd digestive Plaisters, such aS those of
          <lb/>Melilot, de Ranis cum Mercurio, Diachylum, and such-like.-'
          <lb/>At the same time the Patient must observe a Very strict Regimen
          <lb/>in his Dint, and Way of Living, confining himself principally
          <lb/>to Liquids, prepared of Water, Barley, Oatmeal, and the like.
          <lb/>His common Drink may he Ptisan, prepared of Barley, Liquorice.
          <lb/>Anise, or Fennel, or a second Decoction of the Woods,
          <lb/>or Very, small Beer. Wine, Brandy, and all Kinds os generous
          <lb/>Liquors, are carefully to he avoided, as exasperating the Inflammation.
          <lb/>By observing strictly these Rules, the Venereal Buhoes,
          <lb/>if not inveterate, may Very commodioufly he resolv'd
          <lb/>without Fear Or Danger.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When the Assistance of the Physician is call’d late, or the
          <lb/>Buboes are too malignant to he cured by way of Dissolution,
          <lb/>or it may he thought proper, for some other Reasons, to
          <lb/>attempt the Cure by Suppuration, our chief Care, in order to
          <lb/>the expelling and subduing the contagious Matter, is to he
          <lb/>directed to the promoting and accelerating as much as possible
          <lb/>the Suppuration. ' And hesides suppurative Piasters, it would
          <lb/>not be amiss, either .wish Linen Cloths, or the.Fingers anointed
          <lb/>with Butter, or Oil, to rub these Buboes frequently and
          <lb/>strongly, till they become red, and then immediately to apply
          <lb/>a maturating Planter ; sor this is an admirable Means of accelerating
          <lb/>the Suppuration. And these Kinds os Plaisters, that is.
          <lb/>Diachylum cum Gummis, or a Plaister of Galbanum, and the
          <lb/>like, are fittest to he apply'd while the Patient is yet able to
          <lb/>walk without much Inconvenience, and may he taken off twice,
          <lb/>thrice, or four times a Day, as Occasion requires, that the

          <lb/>than the Plaisters before-mentioned, may be apply'd. Cataplasms
          <lb/>very convenient for this Purpose are 'those composed os
          <lb/>Onions roasted under hot Ashes, or of Honey and Meal, or os
          <lb/>Ferment ; or, to mention no more, of Crums of white Bread
          <lb/>boiled with Milk and Saffron : These Cataplasms must be apo

        <p rend="indent">With the Use of these external Applications; internal Romedies
          <lb/>must also be administer'd. Thus the Patient is to take a
          <lb/>Draught of eight, ten, or twelve Ounces, os a warm Decoction
          <lb/>of the Woods, two or three times every Day, together
          <lb/>with thirty or forty Drops of the Essence of those Words,
          <lb/>white Burnet, Fumitory, Germander, and the like, and some
          <lb/>Grains of Mercurius dulcis, every Day. Thefe Medicines, by
          <lb/>greatly attenuating the Blood, and forcing it towards the Skin,
          <lb/>. and correcting the Venereal Poison, are Very conducive to Di jo
          <lb/>solution, as well aS Suppuration.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Course must be follow’d till the Matter be either difsolved,
          <lb/>or brought to Maturity. In this latter Case the Knife
          <lb/>is to be used, and an Incision to be made ; but with a great
          <lb/>deal of Care and Circumspection, lest the larger Blood-Vessels of
          <lb/>the Groin or Armpits, which he near, should be wounded,
          <lb/>and a dangerous Haemorrhage thence occasioned. The best
          <lb/>Precaution you can use in this Case, is to take the Head of the
          <lb/>Bubo between your Fingers, and pull it upwards. As to the
          <lb/>Time when the incssion is to he made, this one Observation is
          <lb/>necessary., that it be not too soon nor too late, since both are
          <lb/>dangerous. For as too much Haste pracures Pains, dangerous
          <lb/>Inflammations, and other Mischiess, so too long a Delay, as
          <lb/><hi>Hildanus</hi> assures us, has almost constantiy given Occasion to
          <lb/>the Matter of the Bubo to mix again with the Blood ; and by
          <lb/>Corrupting the whole Mass, to induce the Lues Venerea.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If the Patients be timorous, and dread the Knife, the Buboes
          <lb/>must he open'd by some corroding Medicine, aS the Practice is
          <lb/>in Abscesses. When the Pus is evacuated, the Ulcer must be
          <lb/>throughly cleansed by some Digestive, mixed with a little Venice-treacle,
          <lb/>and red precipitate Mercury. After this a Plaister
          <lb/>of <hi>Diachylum cum Gummie</hi> must he apply'd, in order to mollify
          <lb/>* the Margin of the Bubo ; and when the Ulcer is sufficiently
          <lb/>deterged, it is to he healed up with some vuinerary Balsam and
          <lb/>Lint. . . .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Sometimes thefe Ulcers are so stubborn, as not to he dry'd,
          <lb/>nor conglutinated, by the Help of Medicines, but continually
          <lb/>run with a plentiful Effusion of Sanies. In fuch a Cose, and
          <lb/>when neither the above prescribed Medicines, nor red Precipitate,
          <lb/>nor burnt Alum, are of any effect, there is no other
          <lb/>Way, at least in my Opinion, but to cauterize the corrupted
          <lb/>Part with a hot Iron, by which means the Lymphatic Veffeis
          <lb/>by searing are often effectually Closed.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From the Premises, if I am not mistaken, it plainly appears,
          <lb/>that it is always the heft and most commodious Way, is it can
          <lb/>he done, to discuss Venereal Buboes as soon as may he; or to
          <lb/>attempt the Cure by Resolution, rather than Suppuration. But
          <lb/>when the Blond is so sar infected and corrupted by the Venereal
          <lb/>Poison, as to shew manifest Symptoms os the Lues Venerea,
          <lb/>another Way of Treatment, Proper to that Disease, is required.

        <p rend="indent">When a Bubo is Once opened, if it is neglected, the Lips

        <p rend="indent">As to the Causes, the Buhe, after it is laid open, may degenerate
          <lb/>into a sordid and obstinate Ulcer, by the bad Disposition
          <lb/>Of the Bleed, but more especially if the Venereal Poison
          <lb/>‘ should he latent in the Blood, by which the PuS will he render'd
          <lb/>more acrimonious; but it will never degenerate into a Fistula,
          <lb/>but by the gross Neglect or Ignorance of the Surgeon.</p>
        <p rend="indent">i. For Instance: If an uniktlful Surgeon has made too small
          <lb/>an Aperture in the suppurated Buhe, either with the Knife or
          <lb/>Cautery ; for by this means the Bottom of the Ulcer not heing
          <lb/>Open to the View, nor easily reached by Medicine, it will he
          <lb/>* difficult to discover what Alterations are made within, or to</p>
        <p>apply proper Remedies ; so the internal Parts os the Ulcer
          <lb/>remain foul, whilst the Lips of it," which are more exposed to
          <lb/>the Force Of the Remedies, and are well deterged, hasten to a
          <lb/>Union, by which means a Fistula is necessarily formed. .</p>
        <p><hi rend="sup">c</hi> 2. Is he unwarily Permits theUlcer (though the Opening he
          <lb/>sufficiently large) to tend too soon to a Cicatrix, before the ulcerated

          <lb/>Portion of it at its lower Part, which occupies the Centre of the
          <lb/>Ulcer, or several Membranes by which it adheres, and which
          <lb/>are fo many Pedunculi to it, are lest unsuppurated. For we
          <lb/>know Very well by Experience, that no Ulcer can he ever perfectly

          <lb/>Bottom be ever well deterged, as long, as the least Portion of

          <lb/>Pus he speedily remov'd by dilating the Passage with the Knife
          <lb/>or Cautery, a perfect Union of the Parts will be expected in
          <lb/>Vain ; for though the Lips may seem to tend to a Cicatrix, yet

          <lb/>will by Degrees so contract the Mouth os the Ulcer, that there
          <lb/>will remain a Very small Opening into the Cavity, which will
          <lb/>he wider or narrower, or covered with a Crust or thin Skin.
          <lb/>~ 3. In the mean time the Pus, being confined in the Cavity’
          <lb/>of the Ulcer, and exercifing its Force upon the adjacent Parts,
          <lb/>by distending their Fibres, and inspissating the Lymph, will, in

        <p>3. With respect to their State of Mobility, aS some adhere
          <lb/>loofly to the subjacent Parts, heing moveable either Jo one Side

        <p rend="indent">As to the Causes, a Bubo is converted into a ScirrhuS,
          <lb/>when the Lymph, stagnating in the Celis or Vesicles os the Inguinal
          <lb/>Glands, is more than ordinarily inspissated ; by which
          <lb/>means the Parts being stuffed up, and, by Degrees, brought
          <lb/>ho a inore intimate Contact, it acquires, as it were, a cheesy
          <lb/>Hardness. Rut the Lymph is thicken'd in/this maimer by
          <lb/>several Causes.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I. By itsinatural Vitiated Thickness, by which means, upon
          <lb/>the Accession of the Venereal Poison, it is inspissated, <hi>catcris

        <p rend="indent">2; By ithe too great Quantity or Energy of the Venereal

        <p rend="indent">4. <hi>By</hi> the preposterous Use of topical Repellents, such aS are

          <lb/>Very unadvisedly, since, by this means, the Thickness of the
          <lb/>Lymph heing increas'd, the Bubo becomes scirrhous, which
          <lb/>might otherwise have dispers’d of itself.</p>
        <p rend="indent">5. By the Abuse of topical dispersing or ripening Applications,
          <lb/>which, if they are, unequal to the Office of rendering
          <lb/>the Lymph staid, increase its, Thickness, inasmuch as they
          <lb/>dissipate the thinner and more fluid Parts of it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">6; Lastly, by the Abuse os stimulating topical Applications.
          <lb/>Of this sort, are the ripening Cataplasms, with which bruised,

        <p rend="indent">Therefore it is better to have recourse to Mercurial Unction, .

        <p rend="indent">But two things are diligently to he observ'd in the Administration
          <lb/>of the Mercurial Unction.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I. That the Patient he duly prepared with the Use of diluting

          <lb/>or Topics, to soften and relax the Texture of the Buhe, that
          <lb/>the Lymph may have a more free Passage thro' it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The first Intention is answer'd by warm Baths Of River-watCr,

        <p rend="indent">2. That the Mercurial Unction he us’d in finall Quantities

          <lb/>in the Inguinal Glands, and so procure a perfect Resolution of
          <lb/>' the scirrhous Buhe. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">By this Method, it is certain that the inguinal <hi>Scirrhi</hi>, which
          <lb/>succeed the Buhe, are, at least, so much lessen’d, if they are

        <p rend="indent">The scirrhous Buhe, whilst it is becoming cancerous,</p>
        <p rend="indent">I.  Grows hot, has an obscure Pain upon Pressure, swells,
          <lb/>and grows Very hard, sometimes shoots, but seldom ; and then

        <p rend="indent">2.  Then all the Symptoms increase, the shooting Pains are</p>
        <p>more frequent and acute. It changes its Figure? and rises to an

          <lb/>Skin; and now. it is call'd a confirm'd, but occult. Cancer.</p>
        <p rend="indent">3.  Lastly, the Skin dividing upon the Apex, it forms <hi>an-</hi>
          <lb/>Ulcer, frorn whence Blood, Ichor, and Sanies, are discharg'd
          <lb/>Drop by Drop; the Ulcer spreads flowly, the cancerous Bedies

          <lb/>fungous Flesh arises. Ichor, Blood, and Sanies, are discharged

        <p>The whole ^Etiology of the <hi>Canccr</hi> depends upon one Principle,.
          <lb/>which has been hitherto unregarded, however- true.;
          <lb/>which, is. That the Lymph, stagnating in the scirrhous Body, is
          <lb/>rarefiable by Heat ; and, being once heated, expands itself with
          <lb/>so much the greater Force, as it is increased in Thickness and .
          <lb/>Inspissation.. This is abundantly demonstrated from hence, that
          <lb/>a scirrhous Tumor, when it begins to degenerate into a <hi>Canccr,</hi>.
          <lb/>swells without any Suppuration ; that, upon the Increase os the
          <lb/>-Swelling, Part of the Scirrhus forms an Apex ; lastly, that the
          <lb/>Skin being once broke, the cancerous Matter which is conceal'd
          <lb/>within, rismg up, and, as it were, pouring’ out as soon as
          <lb/>Room is allow'd for its Expansion, by Degrees enlarges.the
          <lb/>TJlcer, and, as it spreads more and more, turns out the Lips of
          <lb/>ine Ulcer all round δ᾽</p>
        <p rend="indent">From hence it follows, that the preternatural Heat which the
          <lb/>' Matter, confin'd in the scirrhous Body, conceives, is the proximate
          <lb/>Cause by which the Scirrhus is converted into a Cancer.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
          <lb/>But it appears, that this kind of Heat is conceived by .the scirrhous
          <lb/>Matters I. '</p>
        <p rend="indent">I.  Whenever the Blood which stows near the Partis render’d - <hi rend="sup">f</hi>

          <lb/>Liquors; by immoderate Venery, Exercise, or Watching.</p>
        <p rend="indent">2.  Whenever the Blood, tho’ it may not he too het, is

        <p rend="indent">3.  Lastly, whenever the scirrhous Tumor is heated heyond
          <lb/>measure, by the Application of Topics, which are actually or
          <lb/>potentially hot, or by the imprudent <hi>Use os</hi> Escharotics.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Therefore all these are to he reckon'd as remote or procatarctic

        <p rend="indent">I. It appears from whet has heen laid, that a Scirrhus heginS

          <lb/>heated and rarefied. Therefore a Scirrhus, degenerating into a

          <lb/>- ‘</p>
        <p>2. The Matter in the degenerating Scirrhus enlarges: The
          <lb/>containing Celis, : therefore, and external Coverings of the

        <p rend="indent">3. The same Matter still rarefying more, and with greater

          <lb/>a shooting Pain. “ ’ * Ἀ</p>
        <p rend="indent">am In the same Proportion that the Matter of the degenerating

        <p rend="indent"><hi>sil As</hi> the scirrhous Matter is not perfectly homogeneous and

        <p rend="indent">6. As one or other Part os the Tumor is more enlarg'd into

        <p rend="indent">In general, the larger cancerous Bubo is of more dangerous

          <lb/>in those of Men. - 'Tis very true, they do, but not in the same
          <lb/>Place; sor these Rings in Women lie just upon the Os Pubis;
          <lb/>and the Ligaments, as soon aS ever they are passed through
          <lb/>them, are strongly inserted with the Tendons into the Bone.
          <lb/>So that, by the Streightness os the Passage, there seems to he
          <lb/>little room for a Hernia here: and is there were, the Gut
          <lb/>must he just forward upon the Os Pubis, as indeed we find
          <lb/>sometimes it does, even as sar aS the very <hi>Labia Pudendis</hi>
          <lb/>But I believe in such Ruptures it will be found generally to
          <lb/>take its Course much more aside, towards the Os Ilium. Arid

          <lb/>in this Place, is plain from the Account <hi>Nuck</hi> gives us of a

          <lb/>form'd a Sack in the Thigh, <hi>per vacua musculorum scpatia.</hi>
          <lb/>And <hi>Hildanus</hi>, in explaining the Reason of a <hi>Hernia Uterina,</hi>
          <lb/>thinks the Extension of the Peritonaeum happen'd <hi>circa foramina
          <lb/>illa, circa qua Bubonocele sit in Mulieribus</hi>: and if we

          <lb/>which is given os the Tumor, we shall find them only applicable
          <lb/>to the Interstice we speak of. How capable the Peritonaeum
          <lb/>is os a large Distention, an Ascites alone will sufficiently
          <lb/>convince us; and that such a Distention aS there is generally
          <lb/>in the present Cafe, without any Rupture, may happen,
          <lb/>not only at its Productions in the Groin, or the Navel, we
          <lb/>may find sufficient Proof in the Writers of Surgery. <hi>Barbette</hi>
          <lb/>gives Instances of such Hernias in the Back, above rhe Navel,
          <lb/>below the Navel, <hi>longe supra Ilia</hi>, he says, which have been
          <lb/>by Mistake cut sor an Abscess. <hi>Paulus</hi> indeed distinguishes the
          <lb/>Intestinal Hernia, as it proceeds either froth a Rupture, or a
          <lb/>Distention of the Peritonaeum; and says exprefly, that the
          <lb/>. Operatinn hy the Knife is only, to be attempted in the latter
          <lb/>Case. .But .whoever with Attention considers the Anatomy of

          <lb/>Tor in a Rupture of the Peritonaeum, if the Operation be perform'd,

          <lb/>given by <hi>Fabricius ab Aquapendente</hi>, as well as by many modern
          <lb/>Authors.</p>
        <p rend="indent">A Bubonocele arises from two different Causes ; for sometimes

          <lb/>to break through. Sometimes on a sudden, and by Violent

          <lb/>Is either lacerated, or, according to the general Opinion of the
          <lb/>Moderns, fo sar distended, as to make way for a Falling thro'
          <lb/>of the Intestines,, sometimes with, and sometimes without the
          <lb/>Omentum. Sometimes only one Side of the Intestine, opposite
          <lb/>to that which joins the Mesentery, is engag'd in the
          <lb/>Perforations or Rings, as <hi>Morgagni</hi> and <hi>Ruyfch</hi> observe, and
          <lb/>of which Mr. <hi>Littre</hi> relates a History in the Memoirs of the
          <lb/>Academy of Sciences for I 7 00.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When this Disorder comes on flowly, and by Degrees, the
          <lb/>Patients for the most part feel no great or frequent Molestations
          <lb/>or Inconveniencies; but if they become sensible of the
          <lb/>Distemper on a fudden, or, after they have long been afflicted
          <lb/>with it, expose themselves too much in the Cold, use Violent
          <lb/>Motion or Straining, sail into a Violent Fit of Anger,' aS I
          <lb/>have observ'd, or make too plentiful a Meal, especially on
          <lb/>gross Aliments, and such as are of bad Juice, they commonly
          <lb/>suffer very severely from it. For not only the Intestines are
          <lb/>miserably distended by the Faces, but sometimes the OpenIngs
          <lb/>or Perforations, through which the Intestines fall, are
          <lb/>straighten'd to such a Degree, as to compress the Intestines in
          <lb/>an extraordinary manner, so as to hinder them from transmitting
          <lb/>any of their Contents, and even to. stop the Circulation os
          <lb/>the Blood in their Veins. Such a Case must almost necessarily
          <lb/>he attended with a great Inflammation of the intestines.
          <lb/>Pains, Inquietude, violent Vomitings, and the Iliac Passion,,
          <lb/>commonly called the <hi>Miserere mei</hi>, just mine same manner as
          <lb/>these Symptoms are excited by an <hi>Omphalocele</hi>, or <hi>Gastroceleb</hi>
          <lb/>and so there is form’d a sort Of <hi>Hernia incarcerate</hi>,' as Physicians
          <lb/>call it. Here take Notice by the way, that they who
          <lb/>labour under a Hernia of the Scrotum, are often exposed to
          <lb/>the same Inconveniencies; for which Reason all Persons afflicted
          <lb/>with a Hernia, whether it he of the Navel, the Groin,
          <lb/>or the Scrotum, ought never to go without a proper Girdle,
          <lb/>Fillet, Bandage, Bracers, or Truss; and, aster they have worn
          <lb/>them, should be Very cautious os leaving them off, for fear of
          <lb/>exposing themselves to the Danger of a <hi>Hernia incarccrata,</hi>
          <lb/>which Very often destroys the Patient ; tho’ it* cannot be deny'd,
          <lb/>that such Disorders may sometimes happen to those whe
          <lb/>are secur'd by Bandage or Trusses, on occasion of hard Rideing,
          <lb/>or any other Violent Commotion of the Body, - by which
          <lb/>the Truss is broken, or mov'd out of its right Place, or
          <lb/>loosen'd in such a manner, that the Intestines force a Passage
          <lb/>out of the Abdomen. Such an Accident once happen’d to the
          <lb/>Duke <hi>de Villeroy</hi>, a Marshal of France, , while he was hunting,
          <lb/><hi>as Dionis</hi> telis us in his Book of Surgery, where he treats of
          <lb/>Hernias. Persons therefore under such an Affliction, should
          <lb/>either ride not at all, or he Very cautious in riding.</p>
        <p rend="indent">A <hi>Bubonocele</hi>, or <hi>Hernia Inguinalis</hi>, is commonly known
          <lb/>by the following Signs: There is a Tumor in the Groin,
          <lb/>which extends itself to the Ring of the Muscles of the Abdomen,
          <lb/>and, when it is not incarcerated, is sometimes Visible,
          <lb/>and then again disappears, according to the different Situations
          <lb/>and Motions of the Body. When we apply our Hand, we
          <lb/>plainly perceive an equably hard Prominence, not unlike an
          <lb/>inflated Intestine. AS the Disorder gradually increases, the
          <lb/>Tumor, when gently depressed with the Hand, and especially
          <lb/>when the Patient lies upon his Back, quite. Vanishes,, retiring
          <lb/>into the Abdomen with a fort of rumbling Noise. But when
          <lb/>there is only a Prolapsus of the Omentum, the Tumor is commonly
          <lb/>softer, and like Fat to the Touch, and not mutable
          <lb/>in Bigness, like that of the intestinal Hemia, but, for.the most
          <lb/>parts constantly appearing the same. When there is a Prolapsus
          <lb/>of both the Omentum and Intestines, there is almost
          <lb/>.Constantly a soft kind of Tumor, which remains after the
          <lb/>Intestines are replaced. A <hi>Homia</hi> which happens suddenly.</p>
        <p>and an incarcerated <hi>Hornia</hi>, are known by the fellowing
          <lb/>Symptoms: The external Tumor, sometimes when only excited
          <lb/>by the Omentum, is remarkably red, with a Hardness
          <lb/>and Inflammation. The Patients suffer most intense Pains,
          <lb/>both internal and external, attended with a Vehement Heat,
          <lb/>or a Fever; and commonly Violent and obstinate Vomitings
          <lb/>quickly succeed, first of the Aliments, and natural Contents,
          <lb/>and at last of the Excrements, with extreme Anguish and Agitations,
          <lb/>under which the Patients are Very much weaken'd,
          <lb/>and saint-at every Turn, till, sailing into a cold Sweat, and
          <lb/>Refrigeration of the whole Body, they at last expire, unless
          <lb/>seasonably reliev'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As <hi>Hernias</hi> in general are accounted shameful Diseases, so
          <lb/>especially are those which affect the Pudenda regarded as
          <lb/>such, and therefore usually kept secret. The EVent also of ,
          <lb/>this Distemper is usually doubtful and dangerous, especially
          <lb/>when it is degenerated into an incarcerated <hi>Bubonocele</hi>. If
          <lb/>the Intestines are not as yet intercepted or engag’d, and the
          <lb/><hi>Hernia</hi> comes on gradually, the Disease is the milder, and less
          <lb/>dangerous, especially when the intestines, after being replaced,
          <lb/>are secur'd and restrain’d by some proper Truss or Bandage,
          <lb/>winch must be constantiy worn for a long while. The Disorder,
          <lb/>however, is Very troublesome, and renders the Patient unfit
          <lb/>sor many kinds of Bufiness; besides, it is to he fear'd, thet
          <lb/>the <hi>Hernia</hi>, tho' never so savourable, should by too streight a
          <lb/>Constriction of the Tumor by the Truss by little and littie,
          <lb/>or perhaps on a sudden, degenerate into a <hi>Hernia incarccrata,</hi>
          <lb/>attended with all the soremention'd dreadful Symptoms. In
          <lb/>a <hi>Hernia incarccrata</hi>, if the intestines be not seasonably replaced,
          <lb/>commonly after the second or third Day, and sometimes
          <lb/>sooner, a Violent Inflammation seizes the Parts, which
          <lb/>in a Very short time destroys the Patient; for which Reason we
          <lb/>must he speedy in our Assistance, and if the Distemper he too
          <lb/>stubborn to yield to Medicines, and the Symptoms are Very
          <lb/>threatening, we are not to delay the. Operation, but enter
          <lb/>upon it sometimes before the Eno os sour-and-twenty Hours ;
          <lb/>for when the Strength of the Patient is exhausted, and red
          <lb/>and black Spots appear on the Tumor, a Sphacelus is indicated,
          <lb/>and a cold Sweat, and total Refrigeration of the Body
          <lb/>bring on Death in a Very sew Hours. In such Circumstances,
          <lb/>therefore, not only all Assistance from the Surgeon is useless,
          <lb/>but it is greatiy to he feared, lest the Patient should expire under
          <lb/>an Operation sufficientiy dangerous of itself, and so the Cause
          <lb/>of his Death, which ought rather to he ascribed to a Sphacelus
          <lb/>of the Intestines, should be rashly and inconsiderately
          <lb/>imputed to the Operation. But when the Symptoms are more
          <lb/>mild, and less urgent, and the Patient is yet sufficientiy strong,
          <lb/>the Use of the Knife may be deferred. When the Omentum
          <lb/>salis Out with the Intestines, there is commonly less Danger,
          <lb/>than when there is an incarceration or Coarctation of the bare
          <lb/>Intestine, the' sometimes a Prolapsus of the Omentum alone
          <lb/>has excited the Symptoms os a <hi>Hernia incarccrata</hi>, as is Observ'd
          <lb/>by several Authors in Cases where after Section they discover’d
          <lb/>nothing but a <hi>Prolapsus</hi> of the Omentum. But as
          <lb/>soon as the Tumor, the Redness and Hardness of it being in
          <lb/>some measure diminish'd, begins to grow black, with a kind
          <lb/>of Softness, or appears with red, livid, or bla<hi rend="u">ckish</hi> Spots, as
          <lb/>we said before, and has lost the Sense of Feeling, and a continual
          <lb/>Vomiting, with a Fever, afflicts the Patient; if the
          <lb/>Pulse be weak, and the Eyes look disturb'd, and, as it were
          <lb/>corneous, we ought to consider these Symptoms as manifest
          <lb/>Indications, that the Intestines are already seiz'd with a Sphacelus.
          <lb/>If the Inflammation be communicated to the interior
          <lb/>Parts, which is conjectur'd by the Distention of the Belly,
          <lb/>and the Elevation of the Navel, there is little or no Hope
          <lb/>of Life. And in the last Place, where there is a Coalition of
          <lb/>the prolapsed Intestines with the other Parts, the Method of
          <lb/>Cure by the Knife usually proves Very doubtful and difficult,
          <lb/>because the intestines can very seldom or never be replaced
          <lb/>within the Belly, unless by means of the Knife they are separated
          <lb/>from the Parts to which they adhere, which is sometimes
          <lb/>impossible m he effected, especially in a <hi>Hernia femora.,
          <lb/>lit</hi>, when the Intestines have made a Coalition with the Cmral
          <lb/>Vein or Artery, as <hi>Garengeot</hi> has observ'd. They may
          <lb/>therefore he thought to be in the right, who are of Opinion,
          <lb/>that the Antients never undertook a Chirurgica! Operation of
          <lb/>this kind ; for neither <hi>Celsus</hi>, nor <hi>Paulus AEgineta</hi>, nor any
          <lb/>Other of the Antients, as far aS I know, have mention’d it.
          <lb/>However, because this Method of Cure has been often found
          <lb/>to he of Service, tho' attended with many and great Difficulties,
          <lb/>we think that in due Season it ought by no means to be
          <lb/>neglected. '</p>
        <p rend="indent">ε. There are, in general, three Methods of Cure, which are
          <lb/>to he chosen according to the Degrees and Age of the Distemper.
          <lb/>Where the prolapsed Intestines may he commodioufly

          <lb/>Patient being said upon his Back, with his Thighs somewhat

        <p>repressed into their proper Situation with all possible Gentleness ;

          <lb/>the Part which transmitted the Intestines, and fasten'd and secured
          <lb/>by a fit Bandage, or Truss, furnished with its Bolster,

        <p rend="indent">This Instrument by keeping the Belly, and the relaxed Parts,

          <lb/>under the Hands of strolling Quacks and Mountebanks, since
          <lb/>a much milder Treatment would heve done the Business; besides
          <lb/>which it ought to be consider'd, thet the sole Aim of
          <lb/>these Pretenders is to extort aS much Money as they can for
          <lb/>the Cure, which costs the Patient a Testicle, and oftentimes
          <lb/>his Life. Elder Persons, who have once experienced the Method

          <lb/>leave them off during their Lives, unless they have a Mind to
          <lb/>run over a new Course of Pain and Trouble; and they ought
          <lb/>no less to avoid all Violent Agitations of the Body. Numbers
          <lb/>of Persons, who have formerly labour'd under a Hernia, with

          <lb/>is grown too hard, and the Inflammation, with the Pai<hi rend="u">sq</hi>, and
          <lb/>stercoraceous Vomitings, are come to a great Height, it is the
          <lb/>Part of a prudent Physician to inform the Friends and Relations
          <lb/>of the Patient, of the great Danger os the Case, and of the
          <lb/>Necessity of having recourse to the Knife, not forgetting to represent
          <lb/>also the Difficulty of an Operation of this kind. And
          <lb/>this is to he done in Season, before the Parient be grown too
          <lb/>weak, or the Intestine corrupted, and the ^dubious Hopes os
          <lb/>Life, by Delay, converted into Fear of present Death, <hi rend="u">that</hi>
          <lb/>the Destruction of the Patient may .not be imputed to the
          <lb/>Surgeon, when it was impossible to save him. When, therefore,
          <lb/>the Patient, with the Consent of his Friends, is willing
          <lb/>to submit himself to the Operation, he is, first of all, to empty
          <lb/>his Bladder, lest, being distended with Urine, it should hinder
          <lb/>the Regress of the intestines, or be hurt with the Knife. The
          <lb/>Urine, then, being discharg'd, the Patient is to be laid on his
          <lb/>Back, on a Table, or the Side Of a Bed, and the Groin, if
          <lb/>hairy, shav'd, that the Hairs may not be an Impediment to the’
          <lb/>Operator. Then, the Head being depress’d, and the Hips
          <lb/>rais'd, the Patient is to be firmly held by some of the strongest
          <lb/>Assistants, the Thigh adjacent to the diseas’d Part being a littie
          <lb/>hent, in order to avoid too great a Distention of the Skin. Aster
          <lb/>this, the Surgeon takes up the Skin, together with all the Fat,
          <lb/>on one Side of the Tumor, whilst an Assistant does the same on
          <lb/>the other, and, raising it as much aS possible, makes a strait In-.
          <lb/>cision with the Knife thro' the Middle of the Tumor, and
          <lb/>afterwards widens the Wound, both upwards and downwards,
          <lb/>as much as he thinks sufficient. But if, by reason of the Violence
          <lb/>of the inflammation, the Skin cannot he taken up in the
          <lb/>manner aforesaid, as it sometimes happens, the Operator takes
          <lb/>hold os the Tumor with the Thumb and middle Finger of his
          <lb/>Left Hand, and, with the greatest Caution, and Steadiness of
          <lb/>Hand, drawing the Knife downwards, makes a strait .Incision
          <lb/>over the Middle os the Tumor; but so flight a one, as only to
          <lb/>divide the Skin, which, in these sorts of Tumors, is usually
          <lb/>very thin, for sear of cutting the Intestines, which sometimes <hi rend="sup">z</hi>
          <lb/>happens, and endangering the Life of the Patient. The Skin ‘
          <lb/>being a littie divided, in the manner directed, a groov'd Prohe
          <lb/>is to he introduc'd between the Skin thus divided and the Tumor,
          <lb/>and the Wound enlarg'd, with the Knife or Scissars, above and
          <lb/>below. After this, the Lips of the.Wound heing kept asunder,
          <lb/>by Hooks, on each Side, and the Knife said aside, to avoid injuring
          <lb/>the Intestines, whatever Portion of Fat, or of the Membrana
          <lb/>Cellulosa, may be found cohering, must he carefully separated,

          <lb/>of the Peritonaeum, and call'd the <hi>Bag</hi>, appears in View.
          <lb/>The modern <hi>French</hi> Surgeons, as <hi>Garengeot</hi> allures us, gently
          <lb/>and warily divide the Laminae of the Membrana Cellulosa, thet
          <lb/>this Part of the Operation may the sooner he over, not with
          <lb/>a blunt Instrument, but with the incision-knife, which they
          <lb/>draw along, not in a perpendicular, but oblique. Direction,
          <lb/>till they come to the Bag before-mention'd, when the utmost
          <lb/>Circumspection is requir'd, in order to avoid wounding the intestines
          <lb/>with the Knife. While we are cutting this Integument,
          <lb/>or Bag, it seems necessary, for the Security <hi>of</hi> the subjacent intestines,
          <lb/>to pinch it up a littie between the Thumb and fore
          <lb/>Finger of the Deft Hand, and, with the Knife, or Sciffars,
          <lb/>warily applied, make a Very flight Incision, or only a small
          <lb/>Perforation. While this is doing, the Surgeon ought not to he
          <lb/>terrify'd,_ if any thing like Serum, or Water, should happen
          <lb/>to gush Put, as if he had wounded an Intestine, (for some sort
          <lb/>of aqueous Liquor almost constantly occurs) but must go on
          <lb/>with the Operation, in cutting upshe Bag, till he comes to the
          <lb/>Perforation, or Annulus of the Abdomen, which is done
          <lb/>by means of a Pair of Prohe-scissiarS, or a Knife, either shait or

          <lb/>-Ring of the Muscles of the Abdomen, in this XArtempt, if
          <lb/>the Surgeon he hinder'd by the included Foeces or Flatus, he

        <p>the Opening, or Ring of the Muscles of the Abdomen, must
          <lb/>he ’enlarg'd to a sufficient Breadth with the Knife, but with
          <lb/>Caution, and inwardly, or towards the Linea Alba, sor fear os
          <lb/>cutting the Epigastric" Artery’, which runs along the Outside,
          <lb/>arid thereby causing an immoderate Effusion os Blood. But is
          <lb/>this should happen, the Blood must he stop'd by a Pledget of
          <lb/>lint, arm'd with a styptic Liquor, and by Compression against
          <lb/>the Os Ileum. If there be an Adhesion os the prolapsed Parts
          <lb/>externally, they must be loosed with the greatest Caution. The
          <lb/>Instruments proper for dilating the Annulus are the Knife, or
          <lb/>the before-mention'd Instruments; and, for Defence of the intestines,
          <lb/>are the Probe, with a Plate in the Figure of a Heart,

          <lb/>which are delineated, <hi>{Tab</hi>. 46. <hi>Fig</hi>. I. and 2.) and are inclosed
          <lb/>in Sheaths, were very much in Request for this Purpose.
          <lb/>The first of these is here represented, (Fry. I.) conceal'd within
          <lb/>its Capsula (A. C.), which, aster its being introduc’d into the
          <lb/>Place os the Prolapsus, by pressing the Plate (B.), comes out
          <lb/>of its Capsula, as isJshewn, <hi>{Fig</hi>. 2. A.) and makes an Incision
          <lb/>in the Place of the Prolapsus, whether it he the Ring of
          <lb/>the Muscles of the Abdomen, or the upper Part of the Bag, in
          <lb/>which the Intestines suffer a Strangulation. But,’ because the
          <lb/>interior Parts are more subject to be cut and wounded, when
          <lb/>the Point of the instrument first comes forth and cuts, than the
          <lb/>Part which compresses the Intestines, the former Instruments
          <lb/>are now justly look'd upon as the most convenient. But lest the
          <lb/>Intestines, as heing remarkably lubricous, should happen to
          <lb/>rush out, and fall upon the Knife, while we are busy in using

          <lb/>Prolapsus heing dilated, the Intestines are to be replac'd, and
          <lb/>secur'd with Linen Compresses, triangular Bolsters, and
          <lb/>the Bandage call'd the <hi>Spica</hi> (see FASCIA). Some first scarify
          <lb/>the Annulus, in order to raise a firmer Cicatrix, by which the
          <lb/>Return of the Hernia is the more easily prevented. This
          <lb/>Practice I judge not to be altogether amiss, especially in a lax
          <lb/>State os those Parts. And some there are who introduce a long
          <lb/>Tent into the Opening of the Abdomen, and apply Bolsters
          <lb/>upon it; which Method, in a recent and simple Disorder, I
          <lb/>think is needless, or rather hurtful; as, on the other hand, in
          <lb/>an inveterate and complicated Disease, where the Humours are
          <lb/>vitiated and putrefy'd, and there is an inward Abscess, it may
          <lb/>he convenient to use a Tent.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tho' the prolapsed Intestines may be successfully replac'd by
          <lb/>the Methods before proposed, it will not be amiss to give a Description
          <lb/>of other Ways, which some eminent Surgeons heve
          <lb/>fry’d. Some, in Imitation, and by the Advice, of M. <hi>Amaud, 2</hi>
          <lb/>famous Surgeon of <hi>Paris</hi>, having perforated the Skin, gently
          <lb/>introduce a groov'd Prohe, shut at the Extremity, as is represented
          <lb/><hi>seTati</hi>. 22. M. and NJ, under the Skin, and, cutting
          <lb/>upon it with blunt-pointed Scissars, enlarge the Wound to a
          <lb/>sufficient Wideness. Then taking held of the Lips of the
          <lb/>Wound with the Fingers of either Hand, with one Finger, of
          <lb/>the other they gentiy separate the Skin from the subjacent Tumor
          <lb/>; and then cutting with the Knife, or Scissars, upon the
          <lb/>Finger, divide the same as the Bulk of the prolapsed Intestines
          <lb/>requires. After this, putting the middle Finger and Thumb
          <lb/>Of the Left Hand upon the Tumor, they take a sharp crooked
          <lb/>Knife in their Right Hand, and, holding it a littie on one Side,
          <lb/>for the sake of better Light, and the more easily to avoid
          <lb/>wounding the Intestines, or their Bag, they very cautiousty cut
          <lb/>thro' all the Tunics whichinclose the Bag, which are sometimes
          <lb/>more, sometimes fewer in Numher, in proportion to the Inveteracyof
          <lb/>the Tumor. If any Blood-Vessels occur, they tie them
          <lb/>in two Places, hefore they cut them, that they may. heve no
          <lb/>Impediment from an Haemorrhage; and whatever Blood happens
          <lb/>to stow from the Wound, is carefully wip'd away with
          <lb/>Linen Cloths. Whatever Pieces or Scales of the Tunics adhere,
          <lb/>on either Side, to the Bag, they are either pull'd off with
          <lb/>the Fingers,, or cut away by the Probe-scissars, introduc'd upon
          <lb/>a groov'd Probe. This done according to Art in every Parti.
          <lb/>cular, the next thing is, with the Thumb and fore Finger, to
          <lb/>take firm hold of the upper Part of the Coat of the Tumor, or
          <lb/>the Bag of the intestines, and distend it upwards. Near this
          <lb/>Bag, separated from whatever, adheres to it, and left entirely
          <lb/>imperforated, the famous M. <hi>Petit</hi> introduces his groov'd Prohe
          <lb/>.with a sheathed Point, under the Annulus, by which the Intestines
          <lb/>fall out, and enlarges the Passages by the Method hefore
          <lb/>prescrib'd.. Then, taking hold of the lower Part, of the Bag
          <lb/>with his Hands,, he gentiy depresses the intestines therein contain'd
          <lb/>towards the Os Ileum, and so, by Degrees, reduces them
          <lb/>.to their former Situation. The Intestines being thus reduced,
          <lb/>for their: better Security against a future Hernia,. he represses</p>
        <p>dso the Bag, being first doubled, thra’ the same Opening, Tim
          <lb/>which, as he assures us, it afterwards hardens by Degrees, and.
          <lb/>firmly closes it up) applying upon it a Linen Ball, made of:
          <lb/>Linen Thread, and cover'd with Linen Cloth, 'call'd by-the
          <lb/><hi>French</hi> M. <hi>Pecills</hi> Pellet, which is first well moisten'd with the
          <lb/>White and Yolk of an Egg, beaten up with a littie Spirit of
          <lb/>Wine, and afterwards squeez'd, and roll'd within the Hands
          <lb/>into a cylindrical or oval Figure. By the Sides os tins Ball, and
          <lb/>also upon it, are plac'd other very small Linen Balls, or Lint;
          <lb/>and, in order to their firm supporting and keeping in the diseas'd

          <lb/>in these Cases, often grow to the external Parts, and, if the
          <lb/>Bag be not open'd, can neither be separated, nor reduced within *
          <lb/>the Belly. (5.) The Bag left entire, especially is it. be Urge,
          <lb/>nay easily give Occasion to a.new Hernia,, and . he a fit Recepacle
          <lb/>for it. (6.) This Method, in case of a Rupture Of the
          <lb/>?eritonaeum, is altogether unsuccessful. These, . and other
          <lb/>Reasons, were Very fitly objected to M. <hi>Petit</hi> by <hi>Manchartus,</hi>
          <lb/>Professor of Physic in the University of <hi>Tubingen</hi>, and formerly
          <lb/>a Pupil of ours. And <hi>Le Dran</hi>, fo often quoted, a Surgeon
          <lb/>of <hi>Paris</hi>, does not at all approve of this Method ; first, be-i
          <lb/>cause no particular Advantage can he perceiv’d to attend it and,
          <lb/>secondly, because, if the Hernia be incarcerated sor several
          <lb/>Days, the Intestine is often corrupted with a Sphacelus, in
          <lb/>which Case the vitiated Parts of the Intestine are .separated,,
          <lb/>and fall off, as it often happens, or at least ought to happen, if

          <lb/>destroy the Patient. For these Reasons I think it a hetter Way,
          <lb/>for the most part, especially if the Disease be inveterate, and
          <lb/>the Tumor large, to oped the Bag, than to leave it entire; anth

          <lb/>Description of so extraordinary an Operation and Cure, for the
          <lb/>Improvement of the Art of Surgery.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Intestines being, by some way or other, restor'd to their
          <lb/>former Situation, aS was directed, some use to make frequent
          <lb/>Incssions and Scarification with the Knife, or Scisiars, in the
          <lb/>upper Part of the Ring, with this View, that a more firm and
          <lb/>solid Cicatrix may be rais'd upon the Wound, in order to prevent
          <lb/>a new Hernia; but a great deal of Care is to he taken,
          <lb/>during this Operation, that the Intessines do not fall out afresh,
          <lb/>or he cut. For avoiding these Accidents, they ought, in the
          <lb/>first place,'to be carefully held, and kept in with a warm Towel;
          <lb/>after this, the Remains of the Tunic of the Bag are to be separated,
          <lb/>then ty'd with a Thread near the Ring, and cut off below
          <lb/>the Ligature ; what is superfluous in the Skin must also be
          <lb/>taken away. The Wound is then to be dress'd with Pledgets os
          <lb/>Lint, and particularly the Ball or Pellet <hi>of Petit</hi> ; and these are
          <lb/>to be secur'd with thick triangular Compresses, and the Bandage
          <lb/>Call'd <hi>Spica inguinalis</hi>. When the Wound is thus dress'd, the
          <lb/>‘Patient should be put to Bed, and some Hours aster he should
          <lb/>lose some Blood, unless already Very weak. During the whole
          <lb/>Course of the Cure, the Patient should lie Very still, with his
          <lb/>Head somewhat low, and his Diet should be spare, and easy of
          <lb/>Digestion, as in other large Wounds. Then, if the Patient
          <lb/>should not have sufficient Stools naturally, they should be every
          <lb/>Day procur'd by emollient Clysters; and, if the Patient should
          <lb/>continue without any bad Symptom sor four or five Days aster
          <lb/>the Operation, we may reasonably expect a Cure will succeed;
          <lb/>to promote which, it will be prudent to purge the replaced Intestines
          <lb/>of all vicious Humours, by some proper laxative Medicine,
          <lb/>administer'd during the first Days; but if Hiccoughs, and
          <lb/>a Fever, supervene, we may be certain, that the Patient is in imminent
          <lb/>Danger, and, perhaps, not to he sav'd by the most
          <lb/>effectual Remedies, tho’ immediately apply'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">With respect to the Dressings, the following Cautions are to
          <lb/>he observ'd: First, the Dressings should not he remov'd, without
          <lb/>urgent Necessity, during the two or three first Days, unless
          <lb/>any noxious Humours contain'd within, or any other sufficient
          <lb/>Cause, render it proper to open it the second Day; but when
          <lb/>the Wound is open'd, it may be cleansed of its Sordes with warm .
          <lb/>Wine, or Spirit os Wine; and the Remainder of the Cure is to
          <lb/>be perform'd as in other Wounds: But care should be taken at
          <lb/>every Dressing, .winch ought to he but once a Day, or once
          <lb/>every other Day, to place the Patient with his Hips elevated,
          <lb/>and his Head depressed, whilst an Assistant compresses the upper
          <lb/>Part of the Wound, to prevent the intestine from sailing out
          <lb/>again, and this till the Cure is perfected. When the Wound
          <lb/>is heal'd, if the Patient be young, he should wear a proper Truss
          <lb/>for a Year or two; but if an Adult, or old Person, the Truss
          <lb/>should he wore during Lise. . But I must not omit taking Notice,
          <lb/>that some think fit, immediately after the Operation,
          <lb/>hefore the Wound is dress'd up, to anoint the whole Abdomen
          <lb/>with warm Oil of Roses, and then to cover it with warm Linen
          <lb/>‘Cloths, which does not appear to be absolutely necessary.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Many of the most considerable Surgeons os <hi>Paris, as Dionis,
          <lb/>Mery, Arnaud, Thibet</hi>, and others, advise the Use of a large
          <lb/>Linen Tent, after the Operation and Reduction of the Intestine,
          <lb/>which heing of a considerable Length and Thickness, and
          <lb/>fasten'd to a Thread, is to be introduced into the Abdomen, to
          <lb/>keep open a Passage for the Vent of such Humours as may he
          <lb/>contain'd within.. <hi>Widenman</hi>, a modern <hi>Gorman</hi> Surgeon, and
          <lb/><hi>Dionis</hi>, direct the Tent to he made about an Inch and a half
          <lb/>long, and an Inch tlrick; and tell us, that it ought not to be
          <lb/>extracted, but to be left in till it falis out spontaneoufly by Suppuration
          <lb/>; but <hi>Petit</hi> condemns the Use of them as pernicious,
          <lb/>by irritating the Parts, and admitting the external Ain, which
          <lb/>may do Injury in the Abdomen: Yet I cannot forbear thinking
          <lb/>the Use of them very proper, when there is, as it frequentiy
          <lb/>happens, a Discharge of putrid Humours to be made from the
          <lb/>Abdomen, in which Case <hi>Le Dran</hi> also approves them; otherwise
          <lb/>the Tent may he omitted, and it may he sufficient to apply»
          <lb/>according to <hi>Petifs</hi> Method, a thick Pallet or Ball only, for the
          <lb/>-more speedy Agglutination of the Wound, together with the
          <lb/>, above-mentionlu Bolsters and Bandage.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If in the Operation, upon Opening the Bag, the Omentum
          <lb/>appears to be suppurated or enlarged, so that it cannot be re.
          <lb/>placed, a Needle, with a double Thread, is to be pass'd round
          <lb/>.the sound Part, and tied on each Side, and the Vitiated Part
          <lb/>afterwards is to he cut off, but the sound is to be returned.</p>
        <p>leaving the Thread hanging out of the Wound. The rest os
          <lb/>the Treatment must be the same aS in other Wounds of the
          <lb/>Abdomen, attended with a Suppuration of the Omentum. But
          <lb/>if the Omentum is only corrupted, but not thicken'd, the corrupted
          <lb/>Part may be left out of the Wound without a Ligature,
          <lb/>and the sound return'd ; and the corrupted Part will separate,
          <lb/>and fall off spontaneoufly by Suppuration.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But if the prolapsed Intestine itself be found already mortified
          <lb/>or corrupted, as sometimes happens when the Operation
          <lb/>has been too long delay'd, the Patient is then in the utmost
          <lb/>Danger; for, under these Circumstances, the Patients generally
          <lb/>die either under the Operation, or soon aster. For this Reason
          <lb/>they are usually deserted by the Surgeon, upon a Supposition of
          <lb/>the impossibility of doing any Service, and the Apprehension of
          <lb/>putting them to further unnecessary Pain: But as it is better to
          <lb/>attempt a doubtful Cure, than abandon the Patient to certain
          <lb/>Destruction, and as replacing the Intestine in this mortified
          <lb/>State would he attended with certain Death, the Surgeon
          <lb/>should cut off the mortified from the sound Part of the Intestine,
          <lb/>and stitch the superior Part os the latter to the Edge of the
          <lb/>Wound, in the manner specified sor Wounds of the Abdomen ;
          <lb/>by which means many have been known to survive the Disorder,
          <lb/>and regain Health, tho' there was little or no Hope of
          <lb/>their Recovery. We are encouraged to this Practice, not only
          <lb/>by our own Experience, but also that of others: Besides, we
          <lb/>are told by <hi>Mery</hi>, that a Man was happily cured, who had sour
          <lb/>or five Feet of his intestine cut off, which was mortified in this
          <lb/>kind of Rupture, and the sound Part joined to the Lips of the
          <lb/>Wound in the abdominal Muscles. <hi>Garengeot</hi> also takes Notice
          <lb/>of a Man, whose Intestine being found mortified upon
          <lb/>opening the Sack, and return'd by the Surgeon,, in that Condition,
          <lb/>into the Abdomen, he had soon aster a Discharge of his
          <lb/>Excrement by the Wound ; and a Month afterwards the Flux,:
          <lb/>by the Wound, not Only lessen’d, hut the Lips of the Wound
          <lb/>itself, heing stopp'd with a Pellet or Ball, tied with a Thread,
          <lb/>gradually heal'd in such a manner, that by untying the same,
          <lb/>when there was Occasion, the Man survived, and had the natural
          <lb/>Function of the Parts perform’d as usual, with but littie
          <lb/>more Trouble.</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>Le Dran</hi> observes, that it is a common Calamity among poor
          <lb/>People, who have had the Misfortune of an incarcerated Rupture,
          <lb/>to mistake it for an Abscess, and to treat it accordingly,
          <lb/>without calling in the Assistance of any Physician or Surgeon ;
          <lb/>by which means they bring the Part to Suppuration, aster intolerable
          <lb/>Pains; and upon its discharging Foeces orWorms, which
          <lb/>I have sometimes observed, they then implore the Help of the
          <lb/>Surgeon. These, he says, generally require nothing more than
          <lb/>the Ulcer to be cleansed daily, and treated with some vulnerary
          <lb/>Medicine, cover’d with a Plaister of the same Kind ; by which
          <lb/>means many such Patients have been recover’d, more by Nature
          <lb/>than Art, the Ulcer heing entirely agglutinated and heal’d ;
          <lb/>whereas in others it has left an Aperture in the Groin, through
          <lb/>which the Foeces, and sometimes Worms, are discharged, as it
          <lb/>were, by a new Anus. In Imitation of Nature therefore, whe,
          <lb/>in this Case, often produces a happy Effect of her own Accord,
          <lb/><hi>Le Dran (Obs</hi>. 6ο.ὰ does not return the corrupted Intestine
          <lb/>into the Abdomen; since by this means the . corrupted Parts,
          <lb/>and the Foeces, sailing into the Abdomen, would bring on the
          <lb/>most dreadful Symptoms, and perhaps Death itself: Nor does
          <lb/>he cut it off, but only, by Incssion, dilates the Place, whose
          <lb/>Narrowness occasions the Strangulation, that the Blood may
          <lb/>have a free Course; and opens the corrupted Part of the intestine,
          <lb/>that the contain'd Sordes may have a fine Discharge.
          <lb/>Thus having applied Vulnerary Medicines, Clothe dipp'd in
          <lb/>camphorated Spirits of Wine, and proper Bandages, to the
          <lb/>Parts, he waits a Separation of the corrupted Parts, and spontaneous
          <lb/>Agglutination of the found Intestine with the LipS of
          <lb/>the Ulcer, since by this means a great deal of needless Labour
          <lb/>may be avoided; but <hi>if</hi> the Surgeon should have injured the
          <lb/>sound Intestine in the Operation, he then thinks it necessary to
          <lb/>stitch the Intestine to the LipS of the Wound, winch, insiaming,
          <lb/>will more intimately unite with each other. .</p>
        <p>Thet the Parts will thus agglutinate, or join together, is
          <lb/>confirm'd by a late Observation of <hi>Ramdohr</hi>, present Surgeon
          <lb/>to his Serene Highness the Duke of <hi>Brunscvick</hi>, who, some
          <lb/>.Years ago, cut off a large Part of a mortified Intestine in a
          <lb/>Woman, who had an incarcerated Rupture, which broke of
          <lb/>itself; and, joining the two found Parts of the Intestine together,
          <lb/>he inserted one into the other, and tied them together
          <lb/>loofly with a String; and, replacing them in the Abdomen,
          <lb/>drew them by the String to the Mouth of the Wound; by
          <lb/>winch means the divided Intestine inflamed, and surprisingly
          <lb/>united, the Woman discharging her Foeces afterwards not thro*
          <lb/>-the Wound, but by the Anus, as before. The Woman aster*
          <lb/>wards lived in a State of Health, till, in about a Year's time,
          <lb/>she died of a Pleurisy; and, upon opening her, the divided
          <lb/>Intestines appear'd to be united with each other, of which he
          <lb/>made a Present to me, together with Part of the Abdomen,. m

          <lb/>exactly to the Pars, they perform the Office of a Bolster, with-</p>
        <p rend="hanging">out galling, or even sitting uneasy on the Patient. These
          <lb/>Instruments are of so great Service, that were People who are
          <lb/>subject to Ruptures always , so . wear them, I helieve Very sew
          <lb/>would die of this Distemper ; fince it often appears, upon Inquiry,
          <lb/>when we perform the.Operation for the <hi>Bubonocele</hi>, that,
          <lb/>the Necessity of the Operation is owing to the Neglect-of
          <lb/>wearing aTrnssi</p>
        <p rend="indent">in the Application of a Truss to these kinds of Swellings, a
          <lb/>great deal of Judgment, is. sometimes necessary; and for want
          <lb/>of it we daily see Trusses put eVen on Buboes, indurated TestiHes,
          <lb/>Hydroceles, <hi>etc</hi>. But, for the Hernias., I shall endeavour
          <lb/>to lay down two or three Rules, in order to guide more posse
          <lb/>tively to the Propriety os applying or forbearing them.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Is there is a Rupture os the Intestine only, it is easily, when
          <lb/>return'd into the Abdomen, supported by an Instrument; but if
          <lb/>i of the Omentum, notwithstanding it may be return'd, yet I
          <lb/>have never found the Reduction to her of much Relief; sor the
          <lb/>Omentum will he uneasy in a Lump at the Bottom of the Belly,
          <lb/>and, upon Removal of the Instrument, drop down again
          <lb/>immediately; upon which Account, seeing the littie Danger ’
          <lb/>. and Pain there is in this kind of Hernia, I never recommend
          <lb/>any thing but a,Bag-truss to suspend the Scrotum, find prevent,
          <lb/>possibly by that means, the Increase of theTumor. The Disference
          <lb/>of . these Tumors will be distinguish’d by the Feel;
          <lb/>that of the Omentum sealing flaccid and rumpled, the other
          <lb/>more even, flatulent, and springy.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Sometimes, in 4 Rupture of both 'the Intestine 'and Omeni
          <lb/>tum, the Gut may he reduced; but the Omentum will still
          <lb/>remain in the Scrotum, and, when thus circumstanced, most
          <lb/>Surgeons advise a Bag-truss only, upon a Supposition, that the
          <lb/>Pressure of a Steel one, by stopping the Circulation os the Blood
          <lb/>in the Veffeis of the Omentum, would bring on a Mortification
          <lb/>: But I heve learnt, from a Multitude of these Cases, that,
          <lb/>if the Instrument be nicely fitted to the Part, it will be a Compress
          <lb/>sufficient to sustain the Bowel, and at the same time not
          <lb/>hard enough to injure the Omentum; so that, when a great
          <lb/>Quantity os Intestine salis down, tho' it is complicated with a
          <lb/>Descent of the Omentum, the Rupture will conveniently and
          <lb/>safely admit of this Remedy.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I have, as yet, consider'd the Rupture aS moveable; but it
          <lb/>happens frequently, that the Intestine, after it has pass'd the
          <lb/>Rings os the Muscles, becomes inflamed; which, enlarging the
          <lb/>Tumor, prevents the Return of it into the Abdomen; and,
          <lb/>becoming every Moment more and more strangled, it soon
          <lb/>tends to a Mortification, unless we dilate the Pastages, through
          <lb/>which it is fallen, with some Instrument, to <hi rend="u">mak</hi>e room for its
          <lb/>Return; which Dilatation is the Operation for the Bubonocele.
          <lb/>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It rarely happens, that Patients submit to this Incision hesore
          <lb/>the Gut is mortified, and it is too late to do Service; not but
          <lb/>that there are Instances of People surviving small Gangrenes,
          <lb/>and even perfectly recovering afterwards. I myself heve been
          <lb/>an Eye-witness os the Cure os two Patients, who, some time
          <lb/>aster the Operation, when the Eschar separated, discharged them
          <lb/>Fceces through the Wound, and continued to do so <hi>sor a few</hi>
          <lb/>Weeks in small Quantities; when, at length, the Intestine adherfd
          <lb/>to the external Wound, and then was fairly heal'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In Mortifications of the Boweis, when fallen out of the Abdomen
          <lb/>into the Navel, it is not very <hi rend="u">un</hi>co<hi rend="u">mm</hi>on sor the whole
          <lb/>gangrened Intestine to separate from the found one; so that
          <lb/>the Excrement must necessarily, ever after, he <hi rend="u">dischar</hi>ged at</p>
        <p>that Orifice : There are likewise a few Instances where the
          <lb/>Rupture of the Scrotum has mortified, and become the Anus,
          <lb/>the Patient doing well in every other respect. These Cases,
          <lb/>however, are only mention'd to fa<hi rend="u">mish</hi> Surgeons with the
          <lb/>Knowledge of the Possibility of such Events, and not to mislead
          <lb/>them so far as to make favourable Inferences with regard to
          <lb/>Gangrenes of the Boweis, which generally are mortal.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Before the Performance of the Operation sor the Bubonocele,
          <lb/>which is always to he done in Extremity os Danger, the
          <lb/>milder Methods are to be tried; these are, such aS will conduce
          <lb/>to sooth the Inflammation ; for, as to the other Intent of softening
          <lb/>the Excrements, I believe it is much to be question'd, whether
          <lb/>there can he any of that Degree of Hardness in the Ileum,
          <lb/>which is the Bowel diseased, as to form the Obstruction: And,
          <lb/>in Fact, those Operators who heve unluckily wounded the Intestine,
          <lb/>have proved, by the thin Discharge <hi>of Foedes</hi> which has
          <lb/>follow'd upon the Incision, that the Induration we feel is the
          <lb/>Tension of the Parts, and not the harden'd Lumps of Excrement.
          <lb/>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Perhaps, except the Pleurisy, no Disorder is more immediately
          <lb/>relieved by plentiful Bleeding than this. Clysters, repeated
          <lb/>one after another, three or four times, if the first or second are
          <lb/>either retain'd too long, or immediately return'd, prove very
          <lb/>efficacious: These are serviceable, not only aS they empty the
          <lb/>great Intestines of their Excrements and Flatulencies, which last
          <lb/>are Very dangerous, but they likewise prove a comfortable Fomentation,
          <lb/>by passing through the Colon, all around the Abdomen.
          <lb/>The Scrotum and Groin must, during the Stay of the
          <lb/>Clyster, he bathed with warm Stoops wrung out of a Fomenta- .
          <lb/>tion, and with these on the Part you must attempt to reduce
          <lb/>the Rupture: For this Purpose let your Patient be laid on his
          <lb/>Back, so that his Buttocks may he considerably above his Head ;
          <lb/>the Boweis will then retire towards the Diaphragm, and give
          <lb/>way to those which are to be push'd in. <hi>Is</hi>, after endeavouring
          <lb/>two or three Minutes, you do not find Success, you may still '
          <lb/>repeat the Trial. I heve sometimes, at the End of a Quarter
          <lb/>of an Hour, return'd fuch aS I thought desperate, and which
          <lb/>did not seem to give way in the least, till the Moment they
          <lb/>went up; however, this must be practised with Caution, for
          <lb/>too much rough Handling will be pernicious.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If, notwithstanding these Means, the Patient continues in
          <lb/>Very great Torture; tho' not so bad as to threaten an irnrnediate
          <lb/>Mortification, we must apply some sort os Pultice to the
          <lb/>Scrotum : That which I use, in this Case, is equal Parts os Oil
          <lb/>and Vinegar, made into a proper Consistence with Oat-meal:
          <lb/>After some sew Honrs the Fomentation is to he repeated, and
          <lb/>the other Directions put in Practice; and if these do not sucheed,
          <lb/>I am inclin'd to think it adviseable to prick the Intestine
          <lb/>in five or six Places with a Needle, as recommended by <hi>Pet or
          <lb/>Lowe</hi>, an old <hi>Englisih</hi> Writer, who says, he has often experienced
          <lb/>the good Effects of this Method in the Inguinal Hernia,
          <lb/>when all other Means have fail'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">After all, should the Pain and Tenseness of the Part,continue,
          <lb/>and Hiccoughs and Vomitings of the Excrements sucheed,
          <lb/>the Operation must take place; for if you wait till a
          <lb/>languid Pulse, cold Sweats, subsiding os the Tumor, and emphysematous
          <lb/>Feel come on, it will be most likely too late, as
          <lb/>they are pretty sure Symptoms of a Mortification.</p>
        <p rend="indent">To conceive rightly of the Occurrences in this Operation,
          <lb/>it must he remember'd, that in every Species os Rupture the
          <lb/>Peritonaeum salis down with whatever makes the Hernia; for
          <lb/>the Contents of the Abdomen heing immediately inveloped in
          <lb/>this Membrane, they cannot push thro' any Orifice, but they
          <lb/>must likewise carry a Part os it along with them : So that, in
          <lb/>the Bubonocele, the Situation of the Tumor will be. in the
          <lb/>Cavity of the Scrotum, upon the Tunica Vaginalis, and Spermatic
          <lb/>Cord.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The best way of laying your Patient will he on a Table of
          <lb/>about three Foot four Inches high, letting his Legs hang down;
          <lb/>then properly securing him, you begin your Incision*above the
          <lb/>Rings os the Muscles, heyond the extremity os theTumor,
          <lb/>and bring it down about half the Length os the Scrotum, thro*
          <lb/>the Membrana Adiposa, which will require Very little Trouble
          <lb/>to separate from the Peritonaeum (call'd the Sack of the Hernia),
          <lb/>and consequently will expose the Rupture for the farther
          <lb/>Processes of the Operation; but I cannot help, once more, recommending
          <lb/>it as a thing of great Consequence, to hegin the
          <lb/>external Incision high enough above the Rings, fince there is
          <lb/>ho Danger in that Part of the Wound; and sor want of the
          <lb/>Room this Incsston allows, the most expert Operators are
          <lb/>sometimes tedious in making the Dilatation. If a large Vessel
          <lb/>be open’d by the Incssion, it must .-he taken up hesore you pro- ’
          <lb/>ceed further. ,</p>
        <p rend="indent">When the Peritonaeum is laid hare, you must cut thro' it
          <lb/>carefully, to avoid pricking the Intestines ; though, to say the
          <lb/>Truth, there is not quite so much Danger of this Accident aS is .
          <lb/>represented ; sor, generally- speaking, the Quantity of Water
          <lb/>separated in the Sack of the Peritonaeum raises it from the Intestine,
          <lb/>and pretents any such Mischief This Discharge of
          <lb/>Water, which follows upon wounding the Peritonaeum, and. </p>
        <pb n="89"/>
        <p rend="indent">the Ignorance of the Structure of the Tunica Vaginalis, have,
          <lb/>made it so generally thought, that Ruptures were received into.the
          <lb/>Cavity of that Tunin<space type="tab"> </space>ss</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>. It has</hi> lately been consider'd by some as an Improvement in
          <lb/>the Operation, to forbear wounding the Peritonteum, and to’
          <lb/>return the Sack entire into the Abdomen, thinking by this
          <lb/>means to make a firmer Cicatrix, and more surely to prevent a
          <lb/>Relapse sor tite future: But, hesides that this Practice is not
          <lb/>founded on Reason, in the very Particular it is recommended
          <lb/>for, the seeming Necessity there is of letting out the Waters,
          <lb/>that are frequently fetid, of taking away the mortified Part of
          <lb/>the Omentum, which we cannot come at without the Incision ;
          <lb/>and lastly, to leave an Opening for the Issue of the Excrements
          <lb/>out os the Wound, in case an Eschar should drop from the Intestine
          <lb/>; put out of Dispute, in my Opinion, the Impropriety of.
          <lb/>this new Method.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Peritonaeum being cut thro', we arrive to its Contents,'
          <lb/>the Nature of which will determine the next Process; sor, is
          <lb/>they be Intestine only, it must directly he reduced; but if
          <lb/>there he any mortified Omentum, it must he cut off; in order
          <lb/>towinch, it is advised to make a Ligature above the Partwounded,
          <lb/>to prevent an Haemorrhage; but it is quite needless,
          <lb/>and in some measure pernicious, as it puckers up the Intestine,
          <lb/>and disorders its Situation, if made close to it. For my Part,
          <lb/>I am very jealous, that Wounds of the Omentum are dangerous
          <lb/>; on which Account I cannot pass over this Part of the
          <lb/>Operation without cautioning against cutting any os it away,
          <lb/>. unless it is certainly gangrened; and, when thathappens, I think
          <lb/>It adViseable to cut off only some of the mortified Part, and
          <lb/>leave the rest to separate in the Abdomen, which may be done
          <lb/>with as much Safety as leaving the same Quantity below a Li-
          <lb/>gature. . '.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When' the Omentum is removed, we next dilate the
          <lb/>Wound ; to do which with Safety, an infinite Numher of Instruments
          <lb/>have heen invented; but, in my Opinion, there is
          <lb/>none we can use, in this Case, with so good Management as a
          <lb/>Knife ; and I have sound thy Finger, in the Operation, R much
          <lb/>hetter Defence against pricking the Bowels, than a Director
          <lb/>which I intended to employ: The Knife must he a little
          <lb/>crooked, and blunt at its Extremity, like the End of a Prohe.
          <lb/>Some Surgeons, perhaps, may not he steady enough Io cut dexreroufly
          <lb/>with a Knife, and may therefore perform the Incision</p>
        <p rend="indent">with Prohe-sciffars, carefully introducing one Blade hetween the
          <lb/>Intestine and Circumference of the Rings, and dilating upwards.
          <lb/>When the Finger and Knife only are employ'd, the manner of
          <lb/>doino the Operation will he by pressing the Gut down with the
          <lb/>sore Finger, and carrying the Knife hetween it and the Muscles,
          <lb/>fo as to dilate upwards about an Inch, which will he a
          <lb/>Wound, large enough. ἐν.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Opening being made,'the Intestine is gradually Io he
          <lb/>pushed into the Abdomen, and the Wound is to be stitch'd up ;
          <lb/>'for this Purpose some advise'the quill'd, and others the interrupted
          <lb/>Suture, to be pass'd thro' the Skin and Muscles ; hut as
          <lb/>there is not so much Danger of the Boweis falling out whan
          <lb/>a Dressing and Bandage are applied, and the Patient all the
          <lb/>while kept upon his Back, but that it may be prevented by one
          <lb/>; or two flight Stitches thro' the Skin only, I think it by all means
          <lb/>adViseable to follow this Method, fince the Stricture of a Ligature
          <lb/>in these tendinous Parts cannot but be dangerous.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Hitherto, in the Description of the Bubonocele, I have sup;
          <lb/>posed it loofe or separate in the Sack and Scrotum ; but it happens
          <lb/>sometimes in an Operation, that we find not only an Adhesion
          <lb/><hi>of</hi> the Outside of the Peritonaeum to the Tunica Vaginalis,
          <lb/>and Spermatic Vesseis, but likewise of some Part of the
          <lb/>Intestines to its internal Surface; and in this Cafe there is so
          <lb/>‘ much Confusion, that the Operator is often obliged to extirpate
          <lb/>the Testicle, in order to dissect away and disentangle the Gut ;
          <lb/>tho', if it can be done without Castration,- it ought. I believe,
          <lb/>however, this Accident happens rarely, except in those Ruptures
          <lb/>thet have been a long time in the Scrotum without returning
          <lb/>; in which Case the Difficulty and Hazard of the Operation
          <lb/>are so great, thet, unless urged by the Symptoms ofan inflamed
          <lb/>Intestine, I would not have it undertaken. I have known two
          <lb/>Instances of Persons so uneasy under the Circumstance of such
          <lb/>a Load in their Scrotum, tho' not otherwise in Pain, as to
          <lb/>desire the Operation, but the Event in both proved fetal;
          <lb/>which,. I think, should make uS cautions how'we expose a'
          <lb/>Life for the sake os a Convenience only, arid teach our Pa'
          <lb/>tients to content themselves with 4 Bag-truss, when in this

        <p rend="indent">The Operation of the Bubonocele in Women so exactly
          <lb/>resembles that perform'd on Men, that it requires no particular

          <lb/>Whet bears a Very near Resemblance to the <hi>Bubonocele, is"</hi>
          <lb/>the Disease which modern Physicians usually call a <hi>Hernia Cruralis</hi>,
          <lb/>or <hi>Femoralis</hi>; for it is seated in the upper and exterior
          <lb/>Part of the Thigh, near the Groin, where the Crural Vein and
          <lb/>Artery descend from the Belly to the Thigh. And tho' this
          <lb/>Disorder he pretty common, especially to the weaker Sex, yet,
          <lb/>which is strange. Very few have taken the Pains to examine or
          <lb/>descriheit ; but it has almost universally pass'd, without Distinction,
          <lb/>for a <hi>Bubonocele</hi>, or <hi>Hernia Inguinalis. Fcrhey'en</hi> was

        <p rend="indent">Tor the better understanding thegenuine Nature and Properties
          <lb/>of this Disease, it will not the amiss briefly to remark, from
          <lb/>Writers of Anatomy, that the Place where the <hi>Musculus Psoas</hi></p>
        <p>and <hi>foliacus</hi>, and over them the Crural Vein and Artery, pass
          <lb/>from the Abdomen to the Thigh, is not sufficiently fortified to
          <lb/>sustain .the Renitency of the Intestines, heing inclosed only
          <lb/>with the Peritonaeum, the Fafcia Lata, and with the Fat and Skin.
          <lb/>Moreover, in Viewing a Sceleton, we may observe in
          <lb/>the OS Ileum, above the Acetabulum, a small Depressure,
          <lb/>which is cover'd by the lower Part of-the <hi>Musculus Obliquus
          <lb/>Descendens</hi>, in manner of a .Ligament extended archwise,
          <lb/>which some call the Ligament <hi>CA-Vifalius</hi>, others the Ligament
          <lb/>of <hi>Poupart</hi>. Thro' this small Opening,.or Arch, .the Intestines

          <lb/>Kind of <hi>Hernia. Garengeot</hi> is ofOpinion, that this Species
          <lb/>of <hi>Hernia</hi> happens more frequently than others ; but, sor my
          <lb/>Part, I have seen and cured Multitudes of <hi>Hernias</hi> of all kinds,
          <lb/>but scarce ever met with two instances of a <hi>Hernia Cruralis</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tho' there he a Very considerable Agreement between the.
          <lb/><hi>Fiemia Inguinalis</hi> and the <hi>Hernia Cruralis</hi>, it is easy chough to
          <lb/>distinguish them by a careful Inspection of the peculiar Place»
          <lb/>in which they are situated: For a <hi>Hernia Inguinalis</hi> is form'd
          <lb/>not far from the Pudenda, where: the Ring of the-Muscles of
          <lb/>the Abdomen, and the <hi>Procesi</hi> osthe Peritonaeum, the Anatomy
          <lb/>of which Parts is necessary to he known, descend to the
          <lb/>Scrotum, and the Tumor extends itself from the Ring towards
          <lb/>the Scrotum. But a <hi>Hernia Cruralis</hi> affects the outer Parts of
          <lb/>the Csioin, usually arising in the uppermost, outer, and fore
          <lb/>Part of the Thigh, above the <hi>Acetabulum</hi>, or at the Juncture of
          <lb/>the Thigh with the <hi>Acetabulum</hi>. This Species os <hi>Himia</hi> is also,
          <lb/>for the most part, lesser and rounder than the <hi>Inguinalis</hi>, and
          <lb/>consequentiy sar more subject to be confounded with a Bubo ;
          <lb/>sor the <hi>Inguinalis</hi> is usually somewhat oblong in Figure. However,
          <lb/>fince the <hi>Hernia Cruralis</hi> has yet no peculiar Word, that
          <lb/>I know of, in <hi>Germany</hi> to express it, I think it would not
          <lb/>be amiss to constitute two Species of <hi>Hernia Inguinalis,</hi>
          <lb/>one of which should be the <hi>Hernia Inguinalis interior</hi>, and
          <lb/>the other, which would be the same with the <hi>Hernia Cruralis,</hi>
          <lb/>should he call'd the <hi>Hernia Inguinalis exterior</hi>.</p>

          <lb/>must be gently put back in their proper Place ; and if they are connected

        <p>This Animal was by the <hi>Latins</hi> also called <hi>Rubeta</hi>, by the
          <lb/><hi>Greeks φξνν</hi>&amp; and φήσαλος, and by the <hi>EngUJh</hi> a <hi>Toad</hi>. It is
          <lb/>among the Number of those Animals which have only one
          <lb/>Ventricle in their Heart, and is of the Frog-kind, tho' somewhat
          <lb/>larger ; for which Reason it is by some called <hi>Rana terrestris,
          <lb/>omnium maxima, et grenenofa</hi>. Its Body is thick, its
          <lb/>Back flat and broad, its Belly turgid and inflated. Its Skin is
          <lb/>full of Tubercles of an unequal Bulk ; and so strong and tough,
          <lb/>that it can hardly be pierced with a sharp-pointed Piece of
          <lb/>Wood. It is of a cineritious Colour, with brown, blackish,,
          <lb/>and yellowish Spots intermixed.- - This Animal moves siowly,
          <lb/>is of the amphibious Kind,' copulates and disposes of its Eggs
          <lb/>in the same Manner with other Frogs, if we except that <hi>American</hi>
          <lb/>Species of <hi>Surinam</hi>, call'd the <hi>Pipa</hi>, the Female of which
          <lb/>lays her Eggs on the Back of the Male, in order to be nourish'd.
          <lb/>The Toad lives upon Insects and Vegetables, but not Earth.It
          <lb/>does not croak like the Frog, but makes an indistinct, obscure
          <lb/>kind of Noise, somewhat resembling the Word <hi>Gru</hi>, or</p>
        <p>I rather <hi>Bu</hi> ; from which Circumstance, some are of Opinion,
          <lb/>it received the Name <hi>Bus.o</hi>. In the Winter, and in the Daytime,
          <lb/>especially when the Sun shines, it is found lurking in
          <lb/>shady Places, Fens, Stables, Collections of Stones, and in
          <lb/>Garden-beds, especially under Sage. It is also sometimes
          <lb/>found in the Hearts of Stones, but these are Circumstances
          <lb/>winch come more properly under the Consideration of the Natural
          <lb/>Historian; than os the Physician. The Toad is by some
          <lb/>affirmed to he a Very long-liv'd Animal. Some are of Opihion,
          <lb/>thet the Toad is called <hi>Rubeta</hi>, from <hi>Rubus</hi>; because
          <lb/>they are sound among the Bramble-bushes in Nurseries and
          <lb/>Hedges. Others think it receiv'd the Name <hi>Rubeta</hi> from the.
          <lb/>reddish Spots sometimes found on its Belly. But these are Controversies
          <lb/>of too trifling a Nature to deserve our Attention or
          <lb/>Regard. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Toad is killed by heing covered over with Tar, by
          <lb/>sprinkling Salt of Tartar upon it, or by being said upon common
          <lb/>Salt; <hi>seeOligerus Jacobaus de Ranis, Eph. N. C. D</hi>. or

          <lb/>produc'd from the Bedies of Ducks when buried, as is reported ; -.
          <lb/>'because, when alive, they were fond os eating Toads ; see <hi>Kir- ’

          <lb/>Toads devour'd by Ducks do not prove poisonous to them..
          <lb/>Neither do Ants sustain any Harm from them, since,faccordingto
          <lb/>the same Author, a Toad thrown into a Nestos these Insects
          <lb/>is soon consumed and eat up by them. Now 'tis certain, that:
          <lb/>neither Ducks Flesh, nor Ants, are possess'd of a poisonous
          <lb/>Quality; but’that the <hi>Toad</hi> proves hurtful and poisonous to
          <lb/>Mankind is sufficiently plain, from numberless Instances ; and
          <lb/>the Toad which lives in dry Places is said to he more hurtful and</p>

          <lb/>told by <hi>Valentinus</hi>, in his <hi>Pandect a Medico-legales</hi>. VVhen the
          <lb/>Toad is enraged, he is said to discharge his Urine in the Eyes of
          <lb/>his Persecutor ; and by that means make Reprisals for the Injury
          <lb/>done him, fince it is thought to he possess'd of a Quality
          <lb/>highly prejudicial to the Eyes. But <hi>Brown</hi> doubts of the Truth
          <lb/>of this Fact, and is of Opinion, that the Toad cannot properly
          <lb/>be said to piss, but, like Binds, discharges its Urine and Foeces
          <lb/>from one and the same Passage ; <hi>Brown’s Fulgar Errors</hi>. According
          <lb/>to <hi>Fallifnerus</hi>, the Toad discharges its Urine, which is
          <lb/>yellow and oleous, from a Passage allotted solely for that Purpose.
          <lb/>But 'tis known from incontested Facts, that this Urine
          <lb/>is not of a poisonous Quality, whether exhibited internally, or
          <lb/>apply'd externally. Besides, an Ophthalmic Virtue is ascrib'd
          <lb/>to the Urine of the Toad ; and’ this a certain Physician informs
          <lb/>us he experienc'd on himself 7. for, whilst he look'd at a large
          <lb/>Toad, which he had run through with his Sword, the Toad,
          <lb/>with a Violent Impetus, discharged his Urine in his Face and
          <lb/>Right Eye, by which Accident a troublesome Itching was excited
          <lb/>for about the Space of half an Hour ; after which his Eye
          <lb/>was not only as well as it was before, but rather clearer, and
          <lb/>Its Sight stronger; for it had formerly heen subject to Redness
          <lb/>and Dimness ; see <hi>Eph.. N. C. D</hi>. 3. <hi>a. J. a. sg</hi>. Another
          <lb/>Physician calis the Ophthalmic Virtue of the Toad's Urine in
          <lb/>Question ; hecause the Quack at <hi>Venice</hi>, who provok'd a Toad
          <lb/>to piss in his Mouth, paid for his Folly, by losing his Life half
          <lb/>an Hour after, though he immediately made use of his boasted
          <lb/>Antidote, in order to prevent the fatal Consequences that might
          <lb/>ensue; and this Physician is os Opinion, that the Liquor dise
          <lb/>charged by Toads, when attack'd by Men, is not their Urine,
          <lb/>but a Liquor darted from their Eyes, which, when a certain
          <lb/>Person who had struck a Toad, receiv'd into his Left Eye, he
          <lb/>immediately felt an Itching in that Fye, winch was soon aster
          <lb/>seiz'd with a burning Hear, an inflammation, a Swelling, and
          <lb/>a kind of Blindness, accompany'd with a darting Pain. But
          <lb/>these Symptoms were at last removed by repeated Instillations
          <lb/>of the express’d Juices of the greater Houfleek, and the broadleav'd
          <lb/>Plantain ; see <hi>Eph. N C. Cent. An o. ICrJ</hi>. Others
          <lb/>ascribe a Venomous Quality both to the Blood, and to the Saliva,
          <lb/>os the Toad, but more especially to the latter ; see <hi>Forest,
          <lb/>Obs. Med. L</hi>. 30. <hi>Obs</hi>. 6. <hi>et y. ia Schol</hi>. Some are of Opinion,
          <lb/>that Nature herself has wisely distinguish'd Venomous
          <lb/>Animals by their ghastly and horrid Colour. Some have also
          <lb/>asserted, that the Person who gazes long on an ill-colour'd
          <lb/>Toad of. an herrid Aspect, becomes pale, and assumes an icteritious
          <lb/>Colour. If 'tis true, that this Circumstance really happens,
          <lb/>I am of Opinion, that it is not to be accounted for from</p>
        <p>any Effluvia passing from the Animal to the Person, but from,
          <lb/>his being struck with Terror upon reflecting on the poisonous
          <lb/>Nature of the Toad, and his entertaining a Notion, that it can
          <lb/>exert its hurtful Qualities at a Distance ; for a.Toad is commonly

          <lb/>is rack'd with a Difficulty os Breathing, his Breath becomes illscented,

          <lb/>Sides of its Head, resembling large Warts. This Species is
          <lb/>Very large, and swell'd as big again as the <hi>European</hi> Toad. It
          <lb/>is of a cineritious or bay Colour: Its Urine and Saliva produce

          <lb/>Breathing, Hiccoughs, Vomitings, Dysenteries; Paintings,

          <lb/>the Poison are to he eliminated by Exercise and the Path, and
          <lb/>by putting the Patient into an hot Oven, or into the Belly of
          <lb/>a fresh-kill'd Animal. The general compound Alexipharmics

          <lb/>But more tragical yet is the Story which <hi>Mexaldus</hi>, in

          <lb/>sporting with his Sweetheart in the Garden, hear a large Bed

          <lb/>to use the same, with the like Event, she dying also thereupon,
          <lb/>that she might not be thought to have deprived him of
          <lb/>Life, without whom she could not live herself Upon which,
          <lb/>by Order of the Magistrate, the Sage was order'd to be dug up
          <lb/>and burnt; when, turning the Ground, hehold, a large and
          <lb/>ghastly Toad appears; which Creature is said to be much delighted
          <lb/>with this Plant ; and which he, says our Author,
          <lb/>should have first Consider'd, who compil'd that Verse,</p>

        <p rend="indent"><hi>This Effect of Sage is however 'more rationally attributed to

          <lb/>on, that they will force their Poison thereinto, and fo over the
          <lb/>whole Body, by the Pores of the pressed Part. Moreover they
          <lb/>cast forth their Venom by Urine, Spittie, Vomit, or Slaver,

          <lb/>whilst the Dinner was getting ready, walking into the Garden
          <lb/>belonging to their Inn, and gathering some Sage-leaves, put

          <lb/>had fully din'd, they were seized with a Vertigo, and lost their
          <lb/>Sight, fainted; and had Convulsions ; they stammer'd with

          <lb/>had eat and drank, only the Deceased had put Sage into their
          <lb/>* Wine. A Physician was afit’d the Question, whether Sage
          <lb/>might be poisoned: He answered affirmatively. But, to
          <lb/>come to the Purpose, it must appear whether any Venomous
          <lb/>Creature hath poisoned the Plant with her Spittie or Sanies.
          <lb/>This, which was lightly pronounced, and only by Conjecture,
          <lb/>was by the Eye sound true; for, at the Root of this Bed of
          <lb/>Sage was sound a Hole in the Ground, full of Toads, who
          <lb/>coming out upon pouring in hot Water, made it credible, that

        <p rend="indent">Since from whet has been said *tis obvious, that in ail Nations
          <lb/>Toads are look'd upon as poisonous Animals, it now remains,
          <lb/>that we take Notice of some other Circumstances relafive
          <lb/>to this Animal. That Toads, then, may he safely eaten,
          <lb/>provided them Sweat, Spit, or Urine, are not swallow'd, is
          <lb/>asserted by <hi>Borelli, Cent</hi>. 2. <hi>Obs. 7sp</hi>. People who have had
          <lb/>the Misfortune to eat boil'd Toads instead of Frogs, have felt
          <lb/>no more terrible Consequences from the Use of such a disagreeable
          <lb/>Fond, than a gentie Excoriation of the Lips, Palate,
          <lb/>Tongue, and Fauces ; from which Circumstance <hi>Fallifncri</hi>
          <lb/>concludes, that the Flesh of Toads is by no means of a poisonous
          <lb/>Quality, but abounds with a Volatile diuretic Salt,
          <lb/>winch, when reduc'd to Powder, may he of excellent Service
          <lb/>in the Dropsy. <hi>Mundius</hi> affirms, that the Toad, that hated
          <lb/>Animal, has Flesh not altogether useless; for, says he, by eating
          <lb/>Toads, and by the natural Salubrity of the Ain, the Lues
          <lb/>Venerea is in some <hi>Antcrican</hi> Islands most infallibly cured.
          <lb/>In <hi>Eph. N. C. D. 2. a</hi>. 7. <hi>o. tfysu rnc</hi> have an Account of
          <lb/>a certain Quack, who affirm'd, that the Whole of a Toad's
          <lb/>Body might safely be eaten, provided the Head was only
          <lb/>thrown away, assigning this Reason for his Assertion, that the
          <lb/>-Toad, at once enrag’d and terrify'd at the the Sight of any Person,
          <lb/>calis together the Force .of his Poifon to his Eyes, and
          <lb/>rhe anterior Parts of his Head, by which means no Parts <hi>of</hi>
          <lb/>the Poifon are left in the rest of his Body. If this is true. Impostors
          <lb/>and Strollers have no. occasion to counterfeit Toads,
          <lb/>by filling the Skins of these Animals with Wine, in order to
          <lb/>make the gazing Croud believe they have devour’d real Toads,
          <lb/>aS we are inform'd they do by <hi>Borelli, in Cent</hi>. 2. <hi>Ohs</hi>. 74.
          <lb/><hi>Fallifneri</hi> also informs us, that the Excrements of this Animal
          <lb/>are not of a poisonous Nature, but endow'd with a highly
          <lb/>diuretic Quality. Upon the Whole, <hi>sitmuller</hi> concludes, that
          <lb/>thetpoifonouS Quality consists entirely in its Fury, or in its
          <lb/>Excrements, especially the Urine, which is impregnated with
          <lb/>an acrid, caustic, volatile Salt, whose acrimonious Quality
          <lb/>seems to he deriv’d from the Aliments on which the Animal
          <lb/>lives, that is, the small Beetles found in its Stomach and
          <lb/>Throat. If instead of the Urine, which, from the Circumstances
          <lb/>already mention'd, does not seem to he poisonous, we
          <lb/>substitute^the venomous Liquor deriv’d from the Body to the </p>
        <pb n="93"/>
        <p>Head, and especially the Eyes, this Conclusion does not feem
          <lb/>improbable. But the Toad does not for <hi rend="u">this</hi> Reason cease to
          <lb/>he properly classed among the Venomous Animals; for tho’
          <lb/>the Viper is not only eaten, but applied to medicinal Purposes,
          <lb/>when the Head, which about the Teeth contains a Bag filled
          <lb/>with a deleterious Liquor, is thrown away, yet the Viper does
          <lb/>not on this account cease to he a poisonous Animal.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In what Cases the Toad is used sor medicinal Purposes, I
          <lb/>now come to consider. <hi>Etmullcr</hi>, then, informs us, that a live
          <lb/>Toad, bruised, proves an effectual Medicine sor the Bite of the
          <lb/>Viper, and other poisonous Serpents, when applied to the
          <lb/>wounded Part. In <hi>Vilseh. Hecat</hi>. I. <hi>Obs</hi>. 53. we have an
          <lb/>Account of a Country-man bit by a Serpent, and that in so
          <lb/>violent a manner, that his Hand and Arm immediately swell'd
          <lb/>io a prodigious Bulk; and the Poison reaching his Heart, he
          <lb/>was seized with frequent FaintingS, so that he seem’d to be on
          <lb/>the Very Brink of Death. But, aster having tried all the ordinary
          <lb/>Methods to no Purpose, he was speedily restored by the
          <lb/>Application of entire Toads dried, which swelled wonderfully
          <lb/>by the Poison they extracted. The Patient in the mean time
          <lb/>had internal Alexipharmics exhibited to him. Some Authors,
          <lb/>aS <hi>Helmont</hi> informs ns, order live Toads to be applied over
          <lb/>both Kidneys, for removing the Dropsy, by a plentiful Difcharge
          <lb/>of Urine. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> affirms, that ToadS are of
          <lb/>fingular Service in the Cure of pestilential Buboes in the Groin,
          <lb/>and such as Women are afflicted with. His Method of preparing
          <lb/>them is, to thrust a Piece of Wood thro' their Heeds,
          <lb/>to hang them up till dry, and then to macerate and mollify
          <lb/>them in Rose-water, after which they must be applied to the
          <lb/>Bubo ; and he affirms, that they extract the pestilential Venom,
          <lb/>fince by applying four or five os them successively they
          <lb/>all become wonderfully tumid by the Poison they have imbib'd.
          <lb/><hi>Helmont</hi>, when making mention of these Circumstances, confesses,
          <lb/>that he has applied Toads to Buboes and Eschars in the
          <lb/>Heads, Breasts, and other Parts of Men and Women, and
          <lb/>that he always found they afforded a speedy Relief and Mitigatiori
          <lb/><hi>of</hi> the Pain; but could never observe, that a Toad applied
          <lb/>in this manner became in the least tumid. I shall here
          <lb/>enumerate the anti-pestilential Virtues os the Toad, in the
          <lb/>Words of the learned <hi>Eramerusr</hi> “ I know, <hi>fays he</hi>, several

          <lb/>" And for a Cure they used no other Means than covering

          <lb/>" it on more effectually, they kept the Toads at the aboveAn
          <lb/>mention’d Parts till they would swell no more by the Poip-
          <lb/>son they extracted. Aster winch they remov'd them, and
          <lb/>" in these stead put other ToadS three or four times successive-
          <lb/><hi>" \v</hi>, till they felt themselves reliev'd."</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>Francisius Joel</hi> affirms, thet a Toad run thro' with a sharp
          <lb/>Probe, dried in the Ain, and moistened in Vinegar, if applied
          <lb/>Io pestilential Carbuncles, extracts all the Poison from the
          <lb/>Body. <hi>Helmont</hi> also from the Toad prepared an Amulet for
          <lb/>the Plague; and others, as <hi>Etmuiler</hi> informs us, prepare Amulets
          <lb/>for the same Purpose of the Bones of Toads, or whole
          <lb/>ToadS mixed up with Ising-glass, which they say. extract the
          <lb/>Poison, and prove a Preservative, if hung about the Neck.
          <lb/>Others bruise whole Toads, .boil them in Vinegar of Roses or
          <lb/>Rue, and with Mucilage ofTragacanth make them up into Troches,
          <lb/>which they wear shout the Neck. Others order the
          <lb/>Toad itself, thrust thm' in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>fuse</hi>, and hung up till
          <lb/>dry, to be hung on the Region of the Heart, as an Amulet
          <lb/>against the Plague. But the last Author immediately subjoins,
          <lb/>that he was told by a certain skilful Physician, that in the Application
          <lb/>of ToadS there was a Necessity for distinguishing
          <lb/>Plagues: That if the Plague arises from a terrestrial and. incoercible
          <lb/><hi>Gas</hi>, exhaling from the Mines and Caverns of the
          <lb/>Earth, in such a Case Amulets prepared of ToadS were proper,
          <lb/>because the Toad attracts such a Gas as a proper Aliment:
          <lb/>But that, when the Plague arises from an unlucky Influx of
          <lb/>the Stars, the most proper Amulet was prepared from Spiders,
          <lb/>fince they attracted the Poison of the Ain See ETMULLER.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The learned <hi>Fallisueri</hi> thinks it probable, that a Toad, or
          <lb/>its Skin, applied to Buboes, or other hard Tumors, may contribute
          <lb/>considerably to their Resolution, and also to the deterging
          <lb/>sordid Ulcers; but he doeS nor believe, that it can defend
          <lb/>the Person who wears it against the Plague. Besides, by eSt-

          <lb/>Powder a second time, by which means the Waters were plentifully
          <lb/>discharg'd by Urine, and the Patient Cured. Thus
          <lb/>the Views of Lust and Avarice were disappointed, and what

        <p rend="indent">There is an anatomical Description of a Toad in <hi>Valentinus's

          <lb/>are enlarged and nourish'd in the Stomach, and afterwards

          <lb/>Men, by the Sperm of these Animals being convey'd into them5
          <lb/>for thus, says he, according to <hi>Aristotle</hi>, the <hi>PrimordiaNeniturce,

          <lb/>without the concurring Care and Nourishment of the Mother ;
          <lb/>as is obvious not only from oviparous Fishes, but from most
          <lb/>Insects, from whose Eggs,'nourish'd in a proper Place, perfect

          <lb/>heing convey'd into the Stomach, is an Opinion universally
          <lb/>received in our Days : Neither, if we argue from Analogy,
          <lb/>shall we find it improbable, that the Eggs of Toads, swallow'd

          <lb/>really there, he thinks it is the Cranium indurated or petrified;
          <lb/>Others heve asserted, that this Stone was produced from the
          <lb/>Viscid Spume deposited upon the Head os a large Toad by a Collection
          <lb/>of Toads, lodged in a Cave in the Winter Season.
          <lb/>Hence <hi>Christephorus Salveldensis</hi> informs us, that in <hi>France</hi> and
          <lb/><hi>Spain</hi> this Stone is only produced by a certain Species os horned
          <lb/>Toad call'd <hi>Borax</hi>, and mark'd with Saffron-colour'd Spots,
          <lb/>and blackish livid Streaks. <hi>Lanranus</hi>, from <hi>Alb. Seba</hi>, informs
          <lb/>us, that the Origin of the Toad-stone is very uncertain, and inVolved
          <lb/>in a kind of impenetrable Obscurity; since, notwithstanding
          <lb/>the large Number of Authors who have wrote con-cerning
          <lb/>them, and endeavour’d by Examination to discover their
          <lb/>Natures, not one has hitherto dar'd to assert, that he has, with
          <lb/>his own Hands, extracted a Stone of this kind from the Head
          <lb/>of a Toad, or even pretended to shew one obtain'd in that
          <lb/>manner; for <hi>Fallis.ncri</hi>, after all the Pains he could take, coulth
          <lb/>by no means obtain any Stone from the Toad; from which
          <lb/>Circumstance, he thinks, he has Reason to conclude, that this
          <lb/>Stone being found in the Toad is a Story, which, like feme
          <lb/>other Pieces of Imposture, has met with a kindly Welcome from
          <lb/>the Credulity of Mankind. <hi>Metres</hi>,. in his <hi>Pinax Rerum Na..'
          <lb/>turalium</hi>, affirms, that the Stones call’d Toad-stones, and accounted
          <lb/>Gems, are only certain Teeth, call'd the Grinders, in
          <lb/>the <hi>Lupus marinus</hi>, or Sea-wolf. .</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>Schroder, as Dale</hi> informs us, recommends the Toad-stone
          <lb/>as a most Valuable Medicine against the Plague, and all kinds of
          <lb/>Poisons.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Some affirm, that the <hi>Bufonites</hi>, or Toad-stone, carried
          <lb/>about any Person, preserves him against all kinds of Poison, and
          <lb/>changes its Colour upon its coming near to a poison'd Cup. But,
          <lb/>as these things are not found to hold in Fact, I think it enough
          <lb/>just to have mention'd them ; only I must observe, with <hi>Boeder</hi>,
          <lb/>that the <hi>Bufonites</hi>, in consequence of its being an alcaline

          <lb/>towards the End, quotes the Wordsof <hi>Diofcorides</hi>, and,
          <lb/>in like manner, makes.two Kinds, the fweet, and the bitter;
          <lb/>the fweet, which is red, is good for the Stomach, but the bitter
          <lb/>Kind is better. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Bulbi</hi> differ in Bigness,
          <lb/>Colour; and Sweetness. . Some Sorts are eaten raw, which,
          <lb/>for thet.Reason, musubefweet; these grow, he fays, in the
          <lb/><hi>Taurica Chersonesus</hi>. Next in Goodness, of the fame kind,
          <lb/>are the <hi>African</hi>, and, after them, the <hi>Apulian</hi>. The <hi>African,</hi>
          <lb/>therefore, must he fweet. <hi>Diofcorides</hi> makes the <hi>African</hi>
          <lb/>Bulbi red and fweet; on the contrary, <hi>Heraclides Toren.,
          <lb/>tinus, in Athenaeus</hi>, says they were white and hitter.
          <lb/>These are Contradictions, yet <hi>Diosecrides</hi> mentions <hi>Hiraclides
          <lb/>Tarentinus</hi> aS one of his Anthers. The antient <hi>Greeks</hi> highly
          <lb/>commend the Bulbus of <hi>Megara. Theophrastus</hi> writes, that
          <lb/>Bulbs, in some Places, are so sweet, that they are eaten raw,
          <lb/>as in the <hi>Taurica Chersonesus</hi>.. At present we are ignorant of
          <lb/>the <hi>Bulbus esculentus of the</hi> Antrents, as well of the sweet as
          <lb/>the bitter Kind ; nor have our Botanists observ’d, thet <hi>Diosc
          <lb/>ccrides</hi> makes two Sorts of <hi>Bulbs</hi>, besides the <hi>Bulbus vomitorius,</hi>
          <lb/>which are the fweet and red, brought out Of <hi>Africa</hi>, and the
          <lb/>common bitter Sort, which were known to every body.</p>

          <lb/>the.Stomacti, because it had somewhat of a pinguious Sweetness.
          <lb/>Perhaps this <hi>Bulbine</hi> was the sweet <hi>Bulbus of Diosecrides,</hi>

          <lb/>makes it heve a Bulb whiter than Snow; and <hi>Theophrastus</hi>
          <lb/>reckons the <hi>Bulbine</hi> among those bulbaceous Plants which were

        <p>They who take the <hi>Cepa Asealenica sor</hi> the <hi>Bulbus</hi> of the

        <p rend="indent">The lower Leaves of<hi>ShephcrcTs-pursc</hi> lie flat on the Ground,
          <lb/>in a round Compass, three or four Inches long, narrow,* and
          <lb/>cut into several Gashes, a littie hairy. The Stalk is {lender,
          <lb/>about a Foot high, branch'd towards the Top, heset with a few
          <lb/>whole Leaves, which are sharp-pointed, and set close on, without
          <lb/>Foot-stalks. The Flowers are small, white, and sourleav'd,
          <lb/>and are succeeded by three square Seed-vessels, in Shape
          <lb/>of a Purse, containing Very small reddish Seed.. The Root
          <lb/>is whitish, woody, and full of Fibres, of but littie Taste.. It
          <lb/>grows every-where among Rubbish, Banks and Walls, and

        <p rend="indent">It is of an herby Taste, a littie saltish, and detersive. The
          <lb/>Juice of its Leaves gives a saint-red Colour to blue Paper,,
          <lb/>which gives us Reason to imagine, that, in this Plant, the Sal
          <lb/>Ammonisc, which is natural in the Salt of the Earth, predo-minates
          <lb/>over the other Principles ; this Sal Ammoniac is dissolv'd
          <lb/>in a considerable Quantity of Phlegm, and is temper'd
          <lb/>.by a good deal of Earth, and a littie Sulphur.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Plant does not yield much Acid, by a Chymical Analysis
          <lb/>; almost all that is extracted from it is Alcaline..</p>
        <p rend="indent">There are but few Plants which yield more concrete Volatile
          <lb/>.Salt, fix'd lixivial Salt, and Earth. These Principles, mix'd
          <lb/>together, render the <hi>Shepherdicepurse</hi> proper to dissolve the
          <lb/>.Blood, when it is thicken'd by foreign Acids, which hinder it
          <lb/>from passing, with its ordinary Velocity, from the Arteries
          <lb/>, into the Veins; to which we may refer the greatest Part of De.fluxions.
          <lb/>Besides, the Earth, which is in this Plant, easily imbibes
          <lb/>the Serosities, which occasion a Relaxation of the Fibres ;
          <lb/>thus, by the Consent of all Authors, it is Vuinerary and ashingent
          <lb/>; it is also believ'd to be febIifuoous and lenitive. The
          <lb/>Juice of its Leaves drank, from four Ounces to fix, is an excellent
          <lb/>Remedy in all Losses of Blood, and in Defluxions attended
          <lb/>with an Inflammation. They boil a Handful of it in
          <lb/>lean Broth, and employ it in Ptisans, Glysters, and Cataplasms.
          <lb/>Its disol'd Water has littie or no Virtue ; it is nothing

        <p rend="indent">Those People are mistaken, who imagine that the styptic
          <lb/>and astringent Qualities of the Shepherd’s-purfe are owing to its
          <lb/>Coldness; for, like <hi>Alcohol</hi> of Wine, it acts by a hot and acrid
          <lb/>.Quality, either strengthening and constricting the Veffeis, by
          <lb/>burning them, or coagulating the Juices by its Heat; when it
          <lb/>is either bruis'd, .and apply'd to Wounds in the Surface of the
          <lb/>Body, or when, in Haemorrhages of the Nose, its expressed
          <lb/>Juice is drawn up the Nostriis, or a Tent dip'd in it put up, and
          <lb/>retain'd in them. In discussing Cataplasms, and febrifuge Preparations,.
          <lb/>to be apply'd m the Wrists, the Shepherd’s-purse is
          <lb/>used in the same Manner, and with the same Intention, that
          <lb/>other hot and stimulating Medicines are. When <hi>Borelli, Cent.</hi>3.
          <lb/><hi>Obs. Qsp</hi>. affirms that the Bulk of a common Nut of bruis’d
          <lb/>Shepherd's-purse, put into the Ears, is an excellent Medicine
          <lb/>for removing the Tooth-ach, I should think, that this Effect
          <lb/>was not to be ascrib'd to the .Coldness, but rather to the Heat
          <lb/>of the Plant, which stimulates -the Nerves, and dissipates the
          <lb/>Cause of the Disorder. But whether, when apply'd to the
          <lb/>Nape of the Neck, or to both Arm-pits, or pressed pretty
          <lb/>hard in the Patient’s Hand till it hecomes warm, or put under
          <lb/>the Tongue, it stops Haemorrhages of the Nose, are Points
          <lb/>which can only be determin'd by Experience. The learned
          <lb/><hi>Pauli</hi> telis us he knew a Man cur'd of a Spitting of Blond by</p>
        <p>mearis Of this Plant, which, during the Paroxysm, he used to
          <lb/>grasp hard, and afterwards putting it between the Soals of his
          <lb/>Feet and his Stockings, he walk’d upon it. But 'tis to be</p>
        <p>observ'd, that, at the same time, the Patient receiv'd the Fume
          <lb/>of the best native Sulphur into his Mouth and Throat. Shepherd's-purse,
          <lb/>applied to the Soais of the Feet,, is said to he an
          <lb/>approv'd Remedy for Head-achs. According to <hi>Etmuller</hi>, its
          <lb/>Juiced put into Ears from which purulent Discharges are made,
          <lb/>heals them ; and, when mix'd with Vinegar and Houfleek, it
          <lb/>allays Inflammations of all kinds, the Gout arising from a hot

          <lb/>Four or six Ounces of its express'd Juice are recommended as a

          <lb/>eminent Physician of <hi>Drefden</hi> ; and the Medicine itself is of
          <lb/>universal Use in <hi>Saxony</hi>, and well deserves our Notice ; sor it
          <lb/>is a powerful Sudorific and Diuretic, with due Management;
          <lb/>.and is an excellent Antispasmodic, especially when mix'd with
          <lb/>Our anodyne Liquor (See VITAE BALSAMUM). Besides, it
          <lb/>recommends itself on account of its grateful Flavour, having
          <lb/>nothing of a nauseous empyreumatic Smell.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Foundation of the Preparation consists in mixing the
          <lb/>volatile, urinous, and oily Spirits of Animais with highly
          <lb/>rectify'd Spirits of Wine, and, with an Addition of balsamic
          <lb/>Species, distilling them over a proper Fire; by winch means we
          <lb/>Obtain a Spirit well impregnated with a Volatile Salt, an empyreumatic
          <lb/>Oil, and resinous, sulphureous, balsamic Particles,
          <lb/>and of no unpleasant Smell and Taste. Tho' there are many
          <lb/>different Preparations of this Spirit, our way of making it is as
          <lb/>follows: </p>
        <p rend="hanging">We take of Spirit of Ivory, saturated with a subtile Oil, and
          <lb/>Volatile Salt, about two Ounces; Sal Ammoniac, four
          <lb/>Ounces; Pot-ash, first dissolv'd in Water, eleven Ounces; .
          <lb/>Amber, finely pulveriz'd, half a Pound ; genuine Oil of
          <lb/>Cedar, or os Juniper, half an Ounce : All thefe Ingredients,
          <lb/>being exquisitely min'd in a Glass Cucurbit, are
          <lb/>to he distil'd in a Sand-heat, by which we extract a Spirit,
          <lb/>endu'd with the aforesaid Virtues. A Volatile Salt first
          <lb/>rises in the Alembic, which is afterwards successively dissolv'd
          <lb/>by the Spirit.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is here to he observ'd, that the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Balsam, or the
          <lb/>fresh Peel of Lemons or Oranges, or Juniper-henies, or any
          <lb/>other balsamic and aromatic Powders, may be us'd instead of
          <lb/>the Ingredients hefore-mention'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the Process, a limpid Spirit, like Water, comes over ;
          <lb/>but the longer it is kept in a Vessel exposed to the Air, the
          <lb/>more yellow it turns, till its Colour he heighten'd almost to a
          <lb/>Redness. If the Glass be silled with this Spirit, and covered
          <lb/>with the Stopple, it will continue clear, and suffer no Alteration
          <lb/>of Colour; whence we are plainly taught, that the Cause
          <lb/>Of this Change is in the Ain. And I am or Opinion, that the
          <lb/>original, and most simple. Acid of the Ain, which is of wonderful
          <lb/>Virtue in exalting the Colour of Sulphur and Oil, Concurs
          <lb/>in this Alteration.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Spirit abounds with an oily volatile Salt ; for the more
          <lb/>a Volatile Salt is impregnated and intimately mix'd with an Oil,
          <lb/>the more easily and readily it unites with highly rectify'^ Spirit
          <lb/>of Wine; and that Salt may immediately be precipitated </p>
        <pb n="102"/>
        <p>from this Spirit, by mixing a sew Drops of Oil of Vitriol with
          <lb/>it, which produce a Coagulation and Precipitation of the Salt
          <lb/>to the Bottom, where it firmly adheres to the Sides of the.Glass..
          <lb/>It is worthy our Observation, that this Volatile Spirit os <hi>Bufsius</hi>. is
          <lb/>endu'd with an almost incredible Virtue, in subverting and ex-,
          <lb/>pelling all kinds of Acids, tho'never so strong ; and these.Efsects
          <lb/>.are attended with different Circumstances and Events.
          <lb/>Thus, if one Part os Spirin os Nitre, or Aqua-fortis, he pour'd
          <lb/><hi>to</hi> three Parts of this Spins, all the Acidity is Toon.taken off,:
          <lb/>without any remarkable Ebussition, and nothing is precipitated:
          <lb/>to the Bottom; the Mixture acquires a mild nitrous Taste, and,
          <lb/>being put into a Silver Spoon, and evaporated by the Heat of a.‘
          <lb/>Candle, leaves a Salt of an exquisitely nitrous .FlaVour. This
          <lb/>Mixture also, on account of the Volatile Nitre which it contains,
          <lb/>is endu'd with excellent Medicinal Virtues ; for, in
          <lb/>acute Distempers, ’ where volatile Medicines are of no Effect,
          <lb/>because os’the violent Motion and Effervescence of the Blond,
          <lb/>this Spirit, mix'd with Spirit os Nitre, and render'd more tem-:
          <lb/>perate, gives all the Relief that can he wish'd, by gentiy carrying
          <lb/>off the morbific Matter. ... ; τ. . : .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Is this Spirit of <hi>Businas</hi> he mix'd with Spirit of Salt strongly
          <lb/>concentrated, there arises a greater Ebullition than in the.
          <lb/>former Case ; but all the Acid is, in like manner, in a very
          <lb/>short time, subdu'd, and the Liquor, turns salt, which, ,in
          <lb/>Disorders of the Stomach, where the Appetite is lost, may be
          <lb/>given with Success, for dissolving Viscid Crudities. When
          <lb/>this Spirit is mix'd with distil'd Oil of Vitriol, there immediately
          <lb/>arises an Effervescence, the Mixture becomes turbid, and all
          <lb/>the Volatile Salt is precipitated to the Bottom ; the Taste of the:
          <lb/>Mixture has nothing of Acidity, but has a grateful Smell.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Reason why there is a Concretion and Precipitation inf
          <lb/>the Volatile Salt at the Mixture of concentrated Oil of Vitriol,
          <lb/>but not with other Acids, seems to be as follows.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Oil of Vitriol, as being a Very strong Acid, unites with inflammable
          <lb/>Spirit of Wine, which is an oily Substante ; hence
          <lb/>the Volatile Salt, which it contains, is precipitated ; hut, from
          <lb/>other acid Spirits, which are weaker, and incapable of so.infimate
          <lb/>a Combination with the inflammable Spirit of Wine, there
          <lb/>follows no Precipitation.. . , . .</p>
        <p rend="indent">From these Experiments we may draw this Conclusion, winch
          <lb/>is Very useful in Practice: That this Spirit, which abounds;
          <lb/>with an oily Volatile Salt, shay he given in large Doses, without
          <lb/>In convenience, in Distempers,. especially chronical ones,
          <lb/>where a strong and copious Acid is lodg’d In the Sinuses os the
          <lb/>Stomach and Intestines, and creates.Disturbancesdn those Parts,

          <lb/>he took Notice, one Evening, of one <hi>Batily</hi>, a <hi>Franciscan</hi>
          <lb/>Monk, and a Very celebrated Preacher of <hi>Bretagne in
          <lb/>France</hi>, who was his Fellow-prisoner, and had his Arm affected
          <lb/>with a terrible Erysipelas ; and, taking Pity of the Man, he
          <lb/>took a small Stone, and hastily dip'd it in a Spoonful of Almond-milk,
          <lb/>immediately taking it out again ; then said to the
          <lb/>Keeper, " Give this to that Monk, and, whether he <hi rend="u">rakes</hi>"
          <lb/>more or less of it, within the Space of one Hour, at furthest,

          <lb/>Actions, where I contracted 4 Friendship with <hi>Butler</hi> , and,
          <lb/>soon after, observ'd an old Washer-woman, who, for about
          <lb/>sixteen Years, had labour’d under an intolerable Hemicrania,

          <lb/>furpris'd; but he look'd at me with a smiling Countenance,
          <lb/>and said, " My dear Friend,, unless you can arrive to such a
          <lb/>" Degree as to be able to cure all Diseases with, only one Re"
          <lb/>medy, you are still het a Novioe in the Art, how many
          <lb/>" Years soever may heve passtd overryour Head.'' I easily
          <lb/>acquiesced in .what he said, because I had learn’d as touch from
          <lb/>the <hi>Arcana</hi> of <hi>Paracelsus</hi>, and was further convinc'd of it by
          <lb/>what I now saw, and expected to see ; - but this new Method of
          <lb/>Curing, I freely confess'd, -was utterly strange *and unknown’
          <lb/>tome. I told him then, that therewas a young Prince in our
          <lb/>Court, Viscount <hi>Ghent</hi> by Title,-, and Brother to the Prince of
          <lb/><hi>Episuoy</hi>, who was so over-run with the Gout, that he was able
          <lb/>to lie only on one Side, and was -quite miserable, and deform'd
          <lb/>with a Multitude of UodouS Swellings. Says he, taking methy

          <lb/>I returned to <hi>Brussels</hi> with these glad Tidings, and told whet

          <lb/>that if he makes me sound, he shall have whatever he will
          <lb/>‘5 ask ; let him but name hiS Price, and I will freely deposit
          <lb/>" .the same in Pledge for his Security." When I return'd to
          <lb/><hi>Butler</hi> the next Day with this.News, it put him in a great
          <lb/>Heat, and he said,<space type="tab"> </space>Your. Prince-is mad and miserable, for</p>

          <lb/>ever afterwards prevail with him to perform whathe had promis'd.
          <lb/>Wherefore I began to doubt whether what I had seen before

          <lb/>happen'd, some time after, that a-Friend of <hi>Butlcr’s</hi>, who was
          <lb/>Master and Overseer of a Glass-house in <hi>Antgricrp</hi>, and of a verygross
          <lb/>Habit ofBody; earnestly hegg'd of <hi>Butler</hi> to be freed from
          <lb/>the Burden of his Fat. <hi>Butlcr</hi> offer'd him a littie Bit of his
          <lb/>Stone to lick once,' that is, to give it one quick Touch with
          <lb/>the Tip of his Tongue every Morning; and, within three
          <lb/>Weeks, I saw him shrunk a full Span at the Breast, and yet
          <lb/>never the worse in Health. This Event inclin'd me to believe, that
          <lb/>he could have made good his Promise, and perform'd a
          <lb/>Cure upon the gouty Person before spoken of But, in the
          <lb/>mean time, finding myself poison'd by some secret Enemy, I
          <lb/>sent to <hi>Butlcr</hi>, at <hi>Vilvorden</hi>, sor a Remedy. I was in a very
          <lb/>languishing Condition, pained in all my Joints, my Pulse beat
          <lb/>double, <hi>sclicrotus</hi>} and, at last, was intermittent, attended
          <lb/>with a Lipothymy, and an utter Decay of Strength. <hi>Butler,</hi>
          <lb/>who was still a Prisoner, immediately order'd the Mesienger,
          <lb/>my Servant, to bring him a little Pot of Oil of Olives, and,
          <lb/>dipping his Stone therein, as usual, sent the Oil to me, with
          <lb/>Directions to put only one Drop of Oil upon one, at least, of
          <lb/>the pained Parts, or one Drop upon each of them, if I pleased.
          <lb/>I did according to his Orders, but receiv'd no Benefit thereby.
          <lb/>In the mean time, my Enemy, heing taken sick, and upon his
          <lb/>Death-bed, sent to ash my Pardon for the Injury he had done
          <lb/>me, and so confirm'd my Suspicion, that I was poison'd. I had
          <lb/>then mo more to do but to use the best means I could to put a
          <lb/>Stop to the Operations of this flow-working Poison, and wholly
          <lb/>to subdue it; and, by the Grace of God, I escap'd. But my
          <lb/>Wife, for some Months, had heen afflicted with a Pain in hen
          <lb/>Right Arm, fo that she could not so much as list her Hand,
          <lb/>much less lift up a Weight, and, with Sorrow and Concern on
          <lb/>my Account, contracted at last a dangerous oedematous Tumor
          <lb/>in both her Legs, which, by Degrees, extended itself
          <lb/>from the Foot as high as the Groin, as appear'd from the .
          <lb/>Pits left by the impression of the Fingers; and, because
          <lb/>her Distemper was owing, to Grief and Concern for my Troubles,
          <lb/>she would take no Physic while her Sorrow lasted. In
          <lb/>this Condition, my Wife finding that <hi>Butlers</hi> Oil had no
          <lb/>Effect upon the, and being willing to pass a Joke upon my
          <lb/>Credulity hefore some Ladies, put only one Drop of this Oil
          <lb/>upon her Right Arm ; the immediate Consequence of which
          <lb/>was, contrary to all Hope, the Restoration of that Arm to its
          <lb/>free Motion, and former Soundness, ἐ We were all shuck with

        <p rend="indent"><hi>Pan Hilmont</hi> proceeds to. relate two more fuch .prodigious
          <lb/>Cures ; one perform'd on a Maid-servant of his, who, front
          <lb/>an Erysipelas, which had thrice afflicted her, and been as often
          <lb/>III cur'd, had her Right Leg os aleaden Colour, and swell’d from
          <lb/>the Knee to the Toes ; the other was on a Widow Gentle-:

          <lb/>Hand. ... .. ...: . . - ε
          <lb/>. Aster this, <hi>says Hilmont</hi>, talk'd <hi>Butler</hi> why so.many Women
          <lb/>could be suddenly cur'd, and I, who lay even at Death's
          <lb/>Door, oppress'd with Pains, In every Limb and Joins, could
          <lb/>not receive the least Relies. He desir'd to know what was my
          <lb/>Distemper, and, when he understood, that it was the Effect of
          <lb/>Poison, he said,That, fince the Cause had betaken itself from
          <lb/>" the inward to the outward Parts, the Oil should have beep
          <lb/>" taken, or the Stone dip'd ;. that Pain,. internally confin'd.
          <lb/>" and nourish'd, could not be . topical or external. " I observ'd.
          <lb/>also, lays <hi>Helmynt</hi>, that this Oil, by Degrees, lost its Efficacy,:
          <lb/>because the Stone, which was (lightly dip'd therein, did not
          <lb/>make a thorough Alteration in its Substance,; but only imparted,
          <lb/>to it a Fragrancy, which in time went ossa Tor mis Stone,'
          <lb/>to the Sighs, and on the Tongue, was like melted Sea-salt;
          <lb/>and it is well known, that Salt cannot be intimately mix'd with
          <lb/>Oil. <hi>Butlcr</hi> also cur'd an Abbess of sufficient Note, who,
          <lb/>for eighteen Years, had her Right Arm swefl'd, with a deprav'd
          <lb/>Motion, with the Fingers extended and immoveable; and this
          <lb/>only with a Touch of the Tongue , upon the Stone. Multitudes
          <lb/>of those who were Witnesses os these strange Events,'
          <lb/>presently suspected there must he some Witchcraft, or diabolical
          <lb/>.Compact, in the Case.; for it is usual with the Vulgar,
          <lb/>and has been so of old, to refer those Events, in which they
          <lb/>think it shameful to confess their Ignorance,: to the cunning
          <lb/>Wiles of evil Spirits. But I am not inclin'd to their Opinion,
          <lb/>because the Remedies are supposed to he natural, and have nothing
          <lb/>unusual besides the Quantity; for no Coremonies, Words,
          <lb/>nor any other suspected Thing, was requir'd. Nor, indeed,
          <lb/>is it lawful,, as sar as human Understanding can perceive, to
          <lb/>transfer the Glory of God, manifested in Nature, to an evil
          <lb/>Spirit. For none of the Women, who were thus cur’d, ever
          <lb/>consulted <hi>Bullen</hi>, as one in the least suspected os Necromancy
          <lb/>and even his first Essays met.with Laughter, instead <hi>os</hi> Faith
          <lb/>and Confidence. However, the:Facility and Celerity of such
          <lb/>away of Curing will, I know, remain suspected by many;
          <lb/>for the fickle and lazy Disposition os the Vulgar, in arduous
          <lb/>and unusual Events, prompts them to judge os all alike, hecause '

          <lb/>It is used in Clysters against bloody Stools, and the Dysentery.

        <p rend="indent">The mo frequent Use of Butter relaxes and debilitates the
          <lb/>Stomach, takes away the Appetite, provokes Reaching^ to
          <lb/>Vomit, and heats much, especially if it he old.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Butter contains much Oil, and a littie Volatile Salt.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It agrees at all times with any Age and Constitution ; those,
          <lb/>however, who have a weak Stomach, ought to use it moderately,
          <lb/>as well as young People of a hot and bilious Nature,
          <lb/>because it inflames, and in these last easily turns into Choler.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Butter is nothing but the Cream of Milk, or the fattest and
          <lb/>most oily Part thereof, which is separated from the Serum or
          <lb/>Whey by Churning; the more sat or oily Parts the Milk contains,
          <lb/>the more Butter it yields ; and therefore you have more
          <lb/>from Cows Milk than any other.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Every body knows, that Butter is used every-where ; and
          <lb/>there is hardly any Sauce made without it. The Northern Peoile

        <p rend="indent">The newer Butter is, the more pleasant and wholsonle yosi
          <lb/>wist find it; and the Reason is, hecause its olly ami saline Principles
          <lb/>are then stnctiy united together; whereas, on the other
          <lb/>hand, when Butter is a llttle too old, it has undergone a fort
          <lb/>of internal Fermentation; which has exalted and disengaged
          <lb/>thefe same Principles, which makes it a llttle sharp, and, at the
          <lb/>same nine, oily and unpleafaur. Now, in order to prevent this
          <lb/>Fermentation, and the better to make the Butter keep, they
          <lb/>salt it; and the Acid of the Sult presetves its Textore.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The good Effects produced by Butter proceed from its oily
          <lb/>and balsamic Principles, which are proper to restore the folid

          <lb/>the sharp Humours they meet with, and several other the
          <lb/>Iike Uses. When they ufe Butter to Excess, these same Principles
          <lb/>so much moisten the Fibres of the Stomach, thet they
          <lb/>lose their classic Virtue.</p>
        <p>Lastly, it is observed, that Butter used immoderately heats
          <lb/>much; and the Reason is, because the oily and fat Parts wherewith
          <lb/>it abounds are easily inflamed ; and therefore this is not
          <lb/>- good Fond for bilious Constitutions.</p>

          <lb/>' costive Constitutions ; but must he hurtful in lax, moist, and

        <p rend="indent"><hi>Boerhaave</hi>, speaking of express’d Vegetable Oiis, thus mentions

        <p rend="indent">Thefe Oiis have one strange Property, whereby, with the

          <lb/>any foreign Body being mixed with them, and thus become
          <lb/>thin, sharp, bitter, rancid, yellow, corrosive, and inflammatory
          <lb/>5 whereas they were before thick, mild, sweet, almost
          <lb/>infipid, white, anodyne, and relaxing. And these surprising

          <lb/>Jaws in the Quinfey, and the fame Oil in a sew Days afterwards
          <lb/>suddenly inflame the Jaws of a Person in Health.? And the
          <lb/>sweeter it was when fresh, the sharper it proves when old and
          <lb/>rancid. Hence Almonds, Walnuts, and Pistachos, become
          <lb/>exceedingly nauseous when rancid, and subject to occasion a
          <lb/>sudden Quinsey in the Throat, and excito a Fever, through the
          <lb/>burning Effeci: they have upon the Mouth, Throat, Stomach,
          <lb/>and Intestines. Physicians, therefore, should be cautious when

          <lb/>from Almonds that were not rancid ; and, in the Heat
          <lb/>of Summer, not kept above twenty-four Hours. The fame
          <lb/>thing is also found in Butter, Animal Fat, Bacon, Marrow,
          <lb/>and the more perfeel: Oik hereof; all which, though innocent
          <lb/>when fresh, become highly nauseous by standing uofalted in a
          <lb/>hot Air, where they turn yellow,' blue, or green, hecorne

          <lb/>being a very stormy Day, with a racing Wind, and great

          <lb/>carries the Water from the Bath, the Spirits in both Thermometers
          <lb/>rose one Eighth. ’ I carried them thence, and set them
          <lb/>in the Bath , upon which the small Bore rose to fourteen inches
          <lb/>three Eighths ; with this fast I stripp’d, and went into the Bath,
          <lb/>and put it upon the Spring at Bottom, next the Pump, and it
          <lb/>rose to fourteen and a half; Then I removed it into the fecond
          <lb/>Spring, which rises out of the black Rock, and it yet ascended
          <lb/>one Sixth of an inch higher ; hut here the Tube heing but sixteen
          <lb/>Inches long, the Air above the Spirits was compress’d into
          <lb/>so narrow a Compass, thet its Resistance was too forcible for '
          <lb/>the Ascent of the Spines. Then I suspended the Spirits upon
          <lb/>the Surface of the Bath, and the Spirits fell down to fourteen
          <lb/>Inches one Tenth; fo that, when the Bath is full, the second
          <lb/>Spring is a one hundred and seventeenth Part warmer than the

          <lb/>them to crystallize: The Bath-water afforded both Sea-salt and
          <lb/>Nitre, but most of the former. The Salts of St. ArnisWdl
          <lb/>were the same in Kind, only they yielded more Nitre then thet
          <lb/>of the Bath. <hi>Bingham</hi> Well-water contains most Nitre of any
          <lb/>of them, and less Marine-sals. I took the Crystais of Nitre
          <lb/>from the Marine-falt, dissolved them, and set them to projecti
          <lb/>into regular Crystals, that I mictit obtain their true Figures..</p>
        <p rend="indent">From the preceding History we draw the following Observations:
          <lb/></p>
        <p rend="indent">That tho’ there is Plenty of Ocre, Iron-stone, and Sulphur,
          <lb/>in the Coal-pits here, which are generally reputed the Caufe of
          <lb/>hot Springs; yet the Water is so, far from being warm, that it
          <lb/>is intensely cold; fo that, in order to caufe Warmth, there .
          <lb/>must either be some other Materials, or there is a Mixture of
          <lb/>other Ingredients, which prevent their Effeci in warming the
          <lb/>Water; or these Ingredients are mix’d in undue Proportions.

        <p rend="indent">Since Lime-stone and Coal cannot agree, we fee, that -the

          <lb/>letter, as this Acid is prejudicial to Lime-:stone ; for, thet it-is

          <lb/>similar in their Nature to common Water, in all other
          <lb/>refpects,. besides their greater. Heat; yet seeing, several of the
          <lb/>above-mention’d tinfluring ingredients, produced in them Phenomena
          <lb/>differing-from those produced in common Water by
          <lb/>them, it must therefore contain fame other Principles then those
          <lb/>of common Water. -</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thol it cannot he denied, that this Water has a Mixture of
          <lb/>different Principles ; yet seeing it is still eight or ten Grains in
          <lb/>a Pint llghter, when cold, than common Water, this shews,
          <lb/>that it has fewer earthy or other gross Parts in it than River,
          <lb/>water.</p>
        <pb n="107"/>
        <p rend="indent">Since common Water, made equally hot with <hi>Buxton</hi> Bathwater,
          <lb/>cools sooner at first, but flower than it toward the latter
          <lb/>End, <hi>Buxton</hi> Mineral Water must of course either have less
          <lb/>gross and foreign Matter in it, or this Matter must exist in
          <lb/>Tmaller Particles in the Water, and so give less Resistance to
          <lb/>the flying off of the less rarefied Particles of Heat. .. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Seeing <hi>Buxton</hi> Water is so much lighter and warmer than
          <lb/>common Water, before it has received any culinary or artificial
          <lb/>Fine into its Pores, to rarely the Air contain'd in it, it is plain,
          <lb/>it brings something along with it, which is equivalent to the
          <lb/>fiery Particles in heated Water; which heing occasion'd by this
          <lb/>Water’s washing Mixtures of several Minerals in its Course,
          <lb/>we shall therefore call that a Mineral Vapour.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Since this Water washes so many Ingredients abounding with
          <lb/>Sulphur, and since we find, that eVen gross Sulphur, by the
          <lb/>Mediation of Lime-stone, communicates some os its Parts to
          <lb/>Water; and also seeing there is constantiy such a Visible sulphureous
          <lb/>Halitus upon the Surface of <hi>Buxton</hi> Water; it is reasonable
          <lb/>to think, that this Water, whilst warm, is impregnated
          <lb/>with a sulphureous Steam or Vapour, as one Part of its
          <lb/>^Mineral Spirit.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From the whole Processes and Experiments made on <hi>Buxton</hi>
          <lb/>Waters, it is plain, that the Minerals, warming and impregnating
          <lb/>these several Springs, are the same; only differing some.what
          <lb/>in the Proportion of their Ingredients.</p>
        <p rend="indent">These Minerals lie in a Stratum, or Bed; from West to
          <lb/>East.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Since <hi>Bingham</hi> Well increases or decreases upon Vicissitudes
          <lb/>of W eather or Seasons, 'tis hence probable, that its Spring is
          <lb/>not supplied from any great Depth in the Earth, but chiefly
          <lb/>from the Surface of the Ground, and the small Hill above ; and
          <lb/>seeing both it, and the small warm Spring beyond it, (which I
          <lb/>have seen quite dry) are so superficially provided, and yet warm,
          <lb/>the impregnating Ingredients seem not to lie Very deep in the
          <lb/>Earth.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Since these Waters continually bring up so large and numerous
          <lb/>Bubbles, with an impetuous Force, from the Bowels of the
          <lb/>Earth, then must their interstices be richly stored with a fine
          <lb/>Air, which produces this Effect.</p>
        <p>Seeing St. <hi>Anatis</hi> was known to he of the fame Nature, and
          <lb/>.threw forth the same Quantity of Water before the Bath-leVel
          <lb/>.was made, that it does fince; and since, from this Well to the
          <lb/>Bath, there is a continued Rock of firm black Lime-stone, or
          <lb/>a Substance hetween Marble and Lime-stone; and especially.
          <lb/>Teeing the mainspring, which supplies this Well, rises up thro'
          <lb/>a black Lime-stone on that Side next the River, and not on
          <lb/>That next the Bath; and, in the last place,, since we find two
          <lb/>Considerable Differences in its Contents from those of the Bathwater
          <lb/>; it is ridiculous to suggest, that this Spring has any Communication
          <lb/>with the Bath.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Since there is such a Difference at sundry times in theWeight
          <lb/>Of these Waters, it follows, that there is no certain Standard sor
          <lb/>determining their specific Gravities ; only this, in the general,
          <lb/>is certain, that they are lighter than other common Water, and
          <lb/>that the lighter they are, so much the more are they impregnated
          <lb/>with the Mineral Spirit, and the fewer extraneous Bodies
          <lb/>they bring along with them; and the lighter they are, the
          <lb/>warmer; and the wanner, the more medicinal.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The more the Pores of the Earth are lock'd up by Frost, or
          <lb/>fill'd with Water, provided these affect not the Springs, the
          <lb/>warmer and lighter is the Water; and the warmer it is, so
          <lb/>much stronger is its Mineral Vapour, and therefore the more
          <lb/>powerful are its Virtues.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From the Use of the Thermometer we fee, first. The
          <lb/>different Degrees of Heat Contain'd in the several Waters.
          <lb/>Secondly, We find that there are different Degrees of Heat
          <lb/>contained in the same Water in the several Seasons os the
          <lb/>Year, and according to the Various Temperatures of the Air.
          <lb/>Thirdly, That these Waters are not relatively, but absolutely,
          <lb/>warmer in Winter than in Summer, in Frost than when there
          <lb/>is none, in a cold than in a hot Season, the Bath at least
          <lb/>being one twentieth Part warmer in Frost or Winter, than in
          <lb/>warm Weather. Fourthly, That, in a great Frost, four Fifths
          <lb/>Of the coldest Water not frozen, and One Fifth of boiling
          <lb/>Water mix'd, make the juft Warmth of common River-water
          <lb/>in het Weather about the Autumnal Equinox. Fifthly,
          <lb/>Thet a Quart of boiling Water added to three Pints of such
          <lb/>cold Water, in an earthen Vessel, at two sundry times, about
          <lb/>seven Minutes Distance from each other, gives the trueWarmth
          <lb/>of <hi>Bunton</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>Or five</hi> Eighths of a Quart of helling Water, added to three
          <lb/>. Pints of common River-water in Summer, gives the exact
          <lb/>Heat <hi>os Buxton</hi> Bath in that Season . and then whatever raises
          <lb/>fuch a Thermometer five Eighths of an inch higher, shews you
          <lb/>the Warmth of <hi>Buxton</hi> Water, in a strong Winter Frosh</p>
        <p rend="indent">By these Experiments we have the Quantity of Water each
          <lb/>Spring sends forth in a given time. Secondly, The Proportion
          <lb/>that the Vehicle and fix'd Parts have to each other.
          <lb/>Thirdly, The Proportions of the Earth and Salts separately.</p>
        <p>And, lastly. Which of the different Salts exceeds the others
          <lb/>in Quantity. . .</p>
        <p rend="indent">From the small Proportion of the fix'd Parts in those Waters
          <lb/>Io these Vehicle, especially considering the small Quantity
          <lb/>that should he drank, it is plain, these. Parts can do little to
          <lb/>the Removal of any obstinate Chronical Disease. Suppose, for
          <lb/>Example, a Man daily drinks four Pints of Water, at most he
          <lb/>swallows not, with this Dose, above five Grains of Lime-stone
          <lb/>Powder, which we shall call an Alcali orAbsorbent, and two
          <lb/>Grains and an half of Marine-salt, and as much Nitre, which
          <lb/>let tis suppose stimulant: Whet can these do ? If he should
          <lb/>drink half that Quantity of common Water that comes from
          <lb/>the white Lime-stone Hilis, he shall have as much alcaline
          <lb/>Earth, is not some fix'd Salt, besides R Vegetable Salt : Yet
          <lb/>who would call these Medicinal Waters ὴ Hence it is plain,
          <lb/>that the Virtues of our Waters consist, first. In the pure,
          <lb/>smooth, sine, common Vehicle; and, secondly. In their
          <lb/>Warmth and Mineral Spirit. ../.i.-./...:..</p>
        <p rend="indent">is the Bath, when its Doors and Windows are shut, wanner
          <lb/>than when open'd ? Is the Bath that is shut np on all Sides,
          <lb/>warmer than St. <hi>AnnPs</hi> Well, winch is only shut up on three
          <lb/>Sides ? IS this warmer again than <hi>Bingham</hi> .Water, that is
          <lb/>wholly exposed to the open Air above and on all Sides? Then
          <lb/>it is plain, that were these Waters kept cluse cover'd, and
          <lb/>their Heat reverberated, they might still:he much warmer..</p>
        <p rend="indent">From the Experiments made with .the. Mixtures, we see
          <lb/>first, from the intestine Motion excited by the acid Spirits,
          <lb/>That the Water contains an Alcali. Secondly, That this Alcall
          <lb/>heing precipitated by a Solution of Sugar of Lead, or the
          <lb/>Water thrown into an Alembic and distilled, and that which
          <lb/>comes over with a flow Fire tried, neither of these Waters ferment
          <lb/>with Acids. Thirdly, Not only the alcaline Nature .of
          <lb/>this Earth, but its Whiteness, shew it to he Lime-stone
          <lb/>Powder, tho' it warm not the Water. after Calcination.
          <lb/>Fourthly, This earth being calcined in a Furnace, which quickly
          <lb/>melts Iron, and then applied to the Load-stone, it attracted
          <lb/>this Dust or Powder briskly ; therefore I conclude it contains
          <lb/>also Iron-stone. Fifthly, Seeing the Water precipitates the
          <lb/>Solution of Silver, and a Part of its Salts runs into Crystals
          <lb/>of a cubic Figure, like a Dye, a Part of its Salt must be-Marine-salt.
          <lb/>Sixthly, Since it lets sail a Sediment with Oil of
          <lb/>Tartar, and Spirit of Hartshorn, and .also affords some long
          <lb/>Crystals with six unequal Sides, terminating at each End in
          <lb/>a Pyramid under several Triangles ; we conclude, it contains
          <lb/>also Nitre. Seventhly, Seeing neither Galis nor other Astrin.gents
          <lb/>alter'd this warm Water, we cannot trace any Vitriol,
          <lb/>either volatile or fix'd, in it, nor does it taste chalybeate;
          <lb/>however the Credulity of some People may impose upon their
          <lb/>Tastes, and tho' the Load-stone, attracts some of its calcined
          <lb/>Earth, it does the same with most other Earths, which never
          <lb/>afforded any Solution Of Vitriol, nor any Appearance of its
          <lb/>Eighthly, Did <hi>Bingham</hi> Well, when putrified, and its Sulphur
          <lb/>spent, become red with Galls, and purple with Solution of
          <lb/>Silvers Then it must not only partake more eminently of Nitre,
          <lb/>but also have more os. the Chalybeate Principle in it, than
          <lb/>any of the rest. - - ss I</p>
        <p rend="indent">Did these Waters afford sundry Proportions of Sediment at
          <lb/>different- times? Then they are not alike fraught with their fin'd
          <lb/>mineral Principles at all times. Secondly, We may hereby
          <lb/>observe, that when their fix'd Contents are least, their Vola-.
          <lb/>tile Principles are most, as in Winter and Very cold Weather;,
          <lb/>and when their Volatile Spirit is smallest or wealtest, their fix'd
          <lb/>Parts are proportionably increased, as in Very dry and het
          <lb/>Weather. Thirdly, Have several Authors examin'd the same
          <lb/>Waters at several times, and found their Contents to differ
          <lb/>in Quantity, but not in Kind ? Then are they not to he arraigned
          <lb/>and accused about small Differences, as is too ordi-</p>
        <p rend="indent">3oes Dr. <hi>Uster</hi> tell us, that St. <hi>Anne's</hi> Water proves emetic
          <lb/>upon swilling down large Quantities os it? This is nothing
          <lb/>peculiar, but what it has in common with all other Water.
          <lb/>Secondly, Does he affert a Quantity of Pit-coal to lie immediately
          <lb/>under the Lime-stone, out os which this Water springs ?
          <lb/>It is furprifing how so good a Naturalist could make, such a
          <lb/>Blunder; sor, first. Lime-stone and Coal are found inconsistent
          <lb/>with each other in the Peak-country. Secondly, Who
          <lb/>eVer found warm Water in Coal ? Thirdly, Tho' the Sediment
          <lb/>of those Waters he Very small, yet it at least affords a
          <lb/>Scruple to a Gallon ; tho' he obtained but one Scruple or two.,
          <lb/>out of four Gallons, this must have heen owing to some Neglect
          <lb/>or Mismanagement. Fourthly, He says the Sediment was
          <lb/>all Salt, and no Stone Powder, whereas the <hi>Bath</hi> yields above
          <lb/>one Half, and sometimes two Thirds of Stone Powder to one
          <lb/>of Salt. Fifthly, The Salt,, he says, is chiefly marine. Tho'
          <lb/>this he true of the <hi>Bath</hi>, yet St. <hi>Annas</hi> Well contains as much
          <lb/>Nitre as Marine-salt, and <hi>Bingham</hi> Well more than either of them.
          <lb/>Nor, sixthly. Can I here overlook <hi>Allents</hi> Account
          <lb/><hi>of</hi> this Waterl For, first. He will have but three warm
          <lb/>Springs here, <hi>viz</hi>. two for Bathing, and one for drinking : </p>
        <pb n="108"/>
        <p>Now the outer Bath is no Spring, but supplied from the inner
          <lb/>Bath. Secondly, He fays, that it is as warm as Blood newly
          <lb/>let out of the Veins; but, had he used a Thermometer in examining
          <lb/>both, he would have found the former much short of
          <lb/>the Heat of the latter. Thirdly, He will have Lead, Iron,
          <lb/>and Sulphur to be the Principles that medicate this Water; bur
          <lb/>how can Lead communicate any of its Parts to the Water,
          <lb/>without it he dissolved ? Where is the Solvent and Menstruum ?
          <lb/>And, if it had a Solvent, it would he Vitriol, which would
          <lb/>long ago haVe corroded and consumed the Lead, and left only
          <lb/>a bright Sulphur; and fince Lead is the chief medicating Principle,
          <lb/>the Springs would now he no more than other common
          <lb/>Springs. But allowing (contrary to Reason and Experience)
          <lb/>that the Lead did still impregnate this Water, it would be
          <lb/>Poison instead of Physic, as we see from the Accidents that
          <lb/>happen to thofe who sinell, and to the Animals that drink the
          <lb/>Waters wherein there is Lead, how soon they are seized with
          <lb/>a <hi>Bellon</hi>, and from the Effects os Sugar os Lead taken inwardly.*
          <lb/>Nor, thirdly. Has the Water a sulphureous Taste
          <lb/>or Smell, as he alledges. Nor, fourthly. Do Galls give
          <lb/>this the same Colour aS they do the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters, nor a
          <lb/>Leaden Colour, winch he will have to arise from Lead. The
          <lb/>Sulphur he will have to be that of Lead, <hi>fanes</hi> is much more
          <lb/>in the Right, when he thinks the Water is too pure, delicious,
          <lb/>and fine, for any such Principles as Lead, Copper, or Alum;
          <lb/>and contents himself with an impalpable Sulphur.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Now let us see what Medicinal Uses these Experiments and
          <lb/>Observations will help us to make of these Waters: In this
          <lb/>we shall receive some Assistance from <hi>Nli.Martiofs</hi> Account
          <lb/>of the Effects of warm Bathing, whereby it is plain, first.
          <lb/>That, by the Waters penetrating the Pores of the Skin, it gets
          <lb/>into, and mixes with, the Bloed, and other Juices, on the Surlsace
          <lb/>of the Body, and thereby increasesits Weight. Secondly,
          <lb/>That, by this Insinuation os the tepid Steam into the Pores,
          <lb/>the Skin is relaxed, its Pores dilated, the Fluids in the Capillary
          <lb/>Veffeis thinned, .their Motion made easier, and their
          <lb/>Evacuation promoted. Thirdly, Tho' the Addition to the
          <lb/>Weight of the Body by Bathing may seem small, yet we must
          <lb/>allow a considerable Discharge by Perspiration during Bathing,
          <lb/>both from the Pressure of the Waters added to that of the Air,
          <lb/>upon the Body, and the warming relaxing Nature of the
          <lb/>Water. But to proceed.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Since these Waters contain so much Air in their Interstices,
          <lb/>they must greatiy promote Digestion, except they he drank
          <lb/>too long; and then, from their Very Warmth and Nature,
          <lb/>they must relax the Stomach, and retard all the Digestions,
          <lb/>unless the Use of them in left off. But the Waters being
          <lb/>warmed by Bodies of a different Nature, either brought together,
          <lb/>diflblv'd; or set in Action, by the Water, this Action
          <lb/>cannot he without the Communication of some of their Parts,
          <lb/>which littie Parts must be lodged, together with the Air, in
          <lb/>the interstices of the Water; then not only does the Air
          <lb/>(consider'd as a finlple Ether) promote Digestion and Attenuation;
          <lb/>but heing springy, and fall of those subtile, invisible,
          <lb/>intractable Particles os Mineral Bodies, or Substances, of
          <lb/>what a diluting, opening Nature must they he in Animal
          <lb/>Bodies ? How near in Smaliness and Subtilty do they approach
          <lb/>to the Particles of Light and Heat, fince we heve no Vessels
          <lb/>that retain one more than the other ? And since they are not
          <lb/>retainable in the cold Water, wherein we suppose the Ain in
          <lb/>a stagnant, compressed State, how trifling is it to imagine or
          <lb/>attempt procuring of them by Force of Fine in Distillation,
          <lb/>whereby the Air is heated, rarefied, and expanded, and even
          <lb/>their Vehicle, the Water, so rarefied, that it rises up ina
          <lb/>Smoak, in both which they are at greater Liberty than before
          <lb/>to make their escape ! .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Since these Particles are so much less, and more-subtie, than
          <lb/>the most Volatile Spirits obtainable by Art, such as those of
          <lb/>Hartshorn and Sal Ammoniac, which may he shut up and
          <lb/>preserved in so porous a Body as Glass, how impossible is it,
          <lb/>that the smallest Vessels in human Bodies, tho' never so much
          <lb/>obstructed, (if not grown, up, and become tendinous} should
          <lb/>hinder their progressive Motion l Will they not eVen find a
          <lb/>Passage between the Interstices of the Fibres that constitute
          <lb/>the Sides <hi>os</hi> the Vessels, and, <hi>a fortiori</hi>, much more in their
          <lb/>Cavities ? How well then must such a Water at the Springhead,
          <lb/>thus fraught with its subtile mineral Principle, be disposed
          <lb/>to carry on the Work of opening and clearing the minutest
          <lb/>Veffeis in the remotest Extremities of Animal Bedies, or
          <lb/>in the smallest Veffeis os the Periosteum, in either ofthe Coats
          <lb/>of the Brain, or Spinal Marrow, or in the Brain or Marrow itself,
          <lb/>which contain the smallest Veffeis comprehensible by
          <lb/>human Conception ? From tins it follows, that these Waters
          <lb/>are better adapted to Obstructions from the twentieth-rate
          <lb/>Vessels, to the smallest in the whole Body, than to those of
          <lb/>the larger and first-rate: No Wonder then, if they produce
          <lb/>such surprising Effects in Gouty, Rheumatic, Arthritic, and
          <lb/>Scorbutic Pains, all which have their Seat in Veffeis so small,
          <lb/>aS scarce th be come at by Medicines. Again, if we consider
          <lb/>this Spirit aS wrapt up in Air, it is not-only subtle and pene-</p>
        <p>stating, but also elastic or springy, so that, when the Heat of
          <lb/>the Body is added to its Warmth, it will he fo much the more
          <lb/>springy, and expand the smallest Vessels, relaxing them, and so
          <lb/>making room for the obstructing Matter either to he expelled’
          <lb/>from the Body, or so attenuated as to he thrown back into
          <lb/>the larger Veffeis, till it is more attenuated, digested, and fitted
          <lb/>for Evacuation by some of the common Outlets. But is
          <lb/>the Water attenuating, and the Spirit elastic ? Then, not only
          <lb/>does the former diflolve the gross Humours, but the Particles of
          <lb/>the latter being got between them, and dilating themselves like a
          <lb/>springy Wedge, will turn the attractive Force of these Humours
          <lb/>into a Repulsive, whereby they are gradually separated,
          <lb/>broken, and mix'd with the intercurrent Fluid; but aS the
          <lb/>Humours cannot be attenuated, and divided into smaller Particles
          <lb/>without increasing their Bulk, especially when at the
          <lb/>same time there is a Quantity of this Water thrown into the
          <lb/>Body, and mix'd with them, this Fusion of the Blood ‘disposes
          <lb/>some of its Parts to get into improper Veffeis; sor one
          <lb/>Globule being hereby divided into two or three, they are then
          <lb/>capable of entering Veffeis that before would not admit nor
          <lb/>receive them when only one ; and these Vessels being conical,
          <lb/>the globular Parts thus divided must stop, before they can
          <lb/>reach the Extremity of the Vestel; hence new Obstructions
          <lb/>of another kind must he produc’d by this powerful Dilutes,
          <lb/>which must remain, except either the Vessel relax, and give
          <lb/>way, or the stopp'd Globule must he split into two or three
          <lb/>others ; but, by this necessary Forde, the Action of the Vessel
          <lb/>is increased, whereby the Blood’S Motion hecomes brisker:
          <lb/>And now both the Quantity and Velocity of the Blood are
          <lb/>increased, but the Coats of the Vessels not being hereby
          <lb/>strengthen'd, but weaken'd, according to Thess greater Dilatation
          <lb/>or Stretch, if they were weak before, and full of Blood,
          <lb/>then Haemorrhages must necessarily follow, except prevented
          <lb/>by due and timely Evacuation, or Reduction of the Humours
          <lb/>to their former Standard, that the Veffeis may again be restor’d
          <lb/>to their natural Dimensions, Strength, and Resistance. But if
          <lb/>we are assur'd from Fact and Experience, that there is a mineral
          <lb/>Spirit in these Waters, and want to know the Nature of
          <lb/>this mineral Spirit, let us get' acquainted with the Minerals
          <lb/>wash'd by the Water, and consider which of them are capable
          <lb/>of having some os their Putts separated by the Water, and which
          <lb/>these Minerals are that can neither have their Parts separated
          <lb/>nor dissolv'd; and we are sure, that this Spirit must be from,
          <lb/>the former; and not from the latter of these: But whet these
          <lb/>Materials are, we have seen before; therefore the Spirit must he
          <lb/>of the same Nature, as its Effects, as well aS Theory, proves</p>
        <p rend="indent">From the Whole we see, that the intention and Effects of
          <lb/>those Waters are Relaxation and Dilution;and where-ever these
          <lb/>are indicated, this Water will be of the greatest Service; which
          <lb/>is, when the natural and necessary Secretions are lessen'd, from .
          <lb/>whence arise Obstructions in the small Veffeis; but it is of
          <lb/>the greatest Benefit in those Ohstructions which arise from a
          <lb/>Sharpness, Saltness, or Earthiness of the Blond and Lymph, or
          <lb/>from an accidental (where there is no natural) Disposition to a
          <lb/>Rarefaction of the Bloed, some of whose Parts have mistaken
          <lb/>their common Road, in all which Cases we suppose a StimuluS
          <lb/>in the Veffeis from Pain; since it is impossible the fix'd
          <lb/>Parts of this Water should prove a powerful Stimulus. Its
          <lb/>Efficacy extends particularly to all Contractions, Stiffness, or
          <lb/>Crispation of the Solids and Veffeis, when their Parte are so
          <lb/>close, that the Fibres are inflexible by such Causes as in a natural
          <lb/>and healthy State should bend them : Or where there is4
          <lb/>Difficulty and indisposition sometimes in the Fibres and Vessels,
          <lb/>preventing their ready and easy Distention and Contraction,
          <lb/>aS is mostly the Fate of old Age, and hard Labourers; .
          <lb/>winch is evident from a more difficult bending and contracting
          <lb/>of their Joints and Muscles, and from their greater Liableness
          <lb/>to Rheumatic and Arthritic Pains; and if young
          <lb/>People be herd plied betimes in Life, their Fibres are sooner
          <lb/>stiffened, become stronger, and are at their Growth, or prevented
          <lb/>of their full Growth, sooner; for by whatever means
          <lb/>Growth is hastened and finished, the Period of Lise is so much
          <lb/>shorten'd. Hence such as are os the slowest Growth, provided
          <lb/>they live regularly, and escape Accidents, live longest, sor the
          <lb/>same Space of Time they sake to Growth, they stand still as
          <lb/>long, and decline the like Time; for should one Man grow
          <lb/>till thirty Years of Age, from that he is at a Stand to sixty,
          <lb/>and grows back again or declines to ninety; then dies: If we
          <lb/>suppose another, who has unnaturally hastened his Growth at
          <lb/>sixteen, he cannot outiive forty-eight or fifty at most : Hence
          <lb/>it is plain, that such aS rejoice at their Childrens early Growth,
          <lb/>and such as are uneasy at their flow Growth, are equally
          <lb/>foolish. It is judicioufly observed by <hi>Sanctorius</hi>, that from the
          <lb/>time Men begin, to decline and grow old. Perspiration is .diminished,
          <lb/>and the gross Parts of the Blood are retain'd; which,
          <lb/>being gathered to the Thorax or Breast, are expectorated by
          <lb/>Coughing, or they are heaped up at the Extremities of the Veisels,
          <lb/>the increasing Stiffness os the Parts still occasioning a Waste
          <lb/>of the more subtie Parts, and a Collection of the grosser Hence

          <lb/>of the Actions depending on the small Fibres, aS Hearing,
          <lb/>Seeing, Memory and Judgment; for the Vesseis of the Brain
          <lb/>being then partiy shut up, and partly become callous, so as to
          <lb/>he unfit for the more noble and elevated Actions, then the
          <lb/>Person becomes childish, and wears out of Lise without much

        <p>Upon the Whole, <hi>Buxton</hi> Water being warrh, highly impregnated

          <lb/>Youth, Men, Women with or not with Child, except
          <lb/>in the first and last Months. No Caution or Difference is here
          <lb/>to be regarded; onsy I would not advise young Persons, Very
          <lb/>full of Blood and Juices, which run with a rapid Course in
          <lb/>their Vesseis, to be too free with them, from the twenty-third
          <lb/>Year os their Age, till the thirtieth. Bilious or choleric Constitutions,
          <lb/>phlegmatic, and melancholic, may use them at Discretion,
          <lb/>provided they do not overdo the Matter ; but the
          <lb/>Sanguine must be a littie more upon the Watch; sor, since they
          <lb/>rarefy the Blood, and increase both its Belk and MotIory, aS
          <lb/>well as add somewhat to its Quantity by bathing; so that their
          <lb/>Vesseis, being pretty well fill’d already, aS often appears, from
          <lb/>their low brisk Pulse, and florid Countenance, here the Waters,
          <lb/>shay distend the Vessels more, drive the Blood forward till it
          <lb/>cause Obstructions, Stagnation, Inflammations, Fevers, or a
          <lb/>Discharge os Bloed, by some Evacuation, from a Rupture of
          <lb/>the stretch'd and weaken'd Vesseis. Neither should I he fond
          <lb/>of assessing phlegmatic gross Bedies, after the Meridian os Life,
          <lb/>to continue it long, except for a sew Days bathing, to open the
          <lb/>Pores of the Skin, attenuate the fizy Humours in its small Vessels,
          <lb/>and discharge a Part of them, and so fit them for a colder
          <lb/>Path, of greater Pressure and Stimulus; nor that I am fond of
          <lb/>Cold-bathing in old Age, when the Spring os thePibres is almost
          <lb/>worn out, but I mean between the Meridian of Life, and old
          <lb/>Age. As to the Season of the Year for using these Waters,
          <lb/>aster so strict an Examination and Investigation of their Parts,
          <lb/>excuse me if I differ from the common Opinion, and prefer
          <lb/>early in the Spring, and late in the Autumn r For, if we consider,
          <lb/>first, the. Luxury of the Age in Eating and Drinking,
          <lb/>simple plain Food, that was the delicate Dish of our long-liv'd
          <lb/>healthy Ancestors, is no longer relish’d ; our Meat must he

          <lb/>Wine, os, which in worse, (aS it is more viscid) strong Aje, or

        <p>the Body ? Secondly, Does not the Water of itself raresy the
          <lb/>Bloed, and relax the Vesseis ? And, thirdly. Are not the Juices
          <lb/>of the Body more rarefied ? Take they not up more Bulk, and
          <lb/>are not the Vesseis more relaxed, in Summer than in Winter?
          <lb/>Is this then a fit Season to send young People of plethoric and
          <lb/>sanguine Constitutions to those Waters ? Either they must use
          <lb/>them for some time, or not; if the latter, why come they to
          <lb/>them ? What Design will a mere complimenting Visit of the
          <lb/>Waters, and, perhaps, tasting them, or going into them,
          <lb/>answer? Sure no valuable End. Is they use them for any considerable
          <lb/>Time, are they not exposed to the Mercy <hi>of</hi> Inflammations,
          <lb/>Faintness, Palpitations, and Fevers, especially of the
          <lb/>hectic Kind ? And will not the Waters answer the same Intention,
          <lb/>with much greater Safety, from the latter End of <hi>March</hi>
          <lb/>to the Middle of <hi>Map</hi>, and from the first of <hi>September</hi> to the

          <lb/>Plenty of Coals, sor the most part some Company, and a.plea-

          <lb/>of Winter, upon urgent and necessary Occasions.? Are not the
          <lb/>Waters considerably warmer ? Does not their Efficacy, chiefly
          <lb/>depend upon their Warmth, and what causes it ? And, the
          <lb/>warmer they, are, are not they the more efficacious and
          <lb/>successful ? Nor is the Bloed so apt to be rarefied, seeing the

          <lb/>declare myself a profess'd Enemy to whet is call'd preparing the
          <lb/>Body for them, by strong Purging, which often causes Pain in
          <lb/>the Bowels, Windiness, Looseness, and Dejection os the Appetite,
          <lb/>the chief thing to be regarded, and kept up, in a Coruse
          <lb/>os Mineral Waters, especially of the warm Kind. Therefore
          <lb/>I content myself with simple plain Laxatives, which unload
          <lb/>the Intestines without Sickness, Pain, Confinement; or Prostration
          <lb/>of Strength or Appetite, as Lenitive Electuary, Rhubarb,
          <lb/>Manna, and Cream of Tartar * Or, if the Stomach is loaded
          <lb/>with Phlegm, pall'd and relax'd, to prevent this being sent
          <lb/>down, and carry'd into, the Body with the Water, and there
          <lb/>doing a great dim of Mischief, I would give a gentle Vomit, as
          <lb/>of the Infusion of Ipecacuanha, or that in Substance to strong
          <lb/>Bodies, and neither order Drinking nor Bathing for thirty
          <lb/>Hours after at least. Young People, full of Blood, or who
          <lb/>have a meagre and quick Pulse, I would order to he blooded
          <lb/>before they begin. Such as are liable to the Gout should neither
          <lb/>he blooded nor Vomited, except there were strong Indications
          <lb/>to the contrary; but let them have <hi>Tonctura Sacra</hi>, or <hi>Elixir
          <lb/>Salutis</hi>, for a Purge. When they begin to drink the Waters, a
          <lb/>Pint hesore Breakfast, and as much after, is sufficient for the
          <lb/>first two or three Days; then half a Pint more sor the two Days
          <lb/>following, and, at most, three Pints in a Forenoon ; for this
          <lb/>Water, not being an Evacuant, hut an Alterative, must not
          <lb/>be thrown into the Body in large Quantities, whereby a great

          <lb/>Minutes to half an Hour, according to the Strength and Cose
          <lb/>Of the Patient. When you come out, if you go not to Bed to

          <lb/>add, once for all, that, as this Water is of such a Nature aS I

          <lb/>the Motion and Quantity of the Blood, and dispose it to
          <lb/>run more impetuoufly upon those Parts, whose Spring and Resistance
          <lb/>is impaired or lost; nor is it to he liberally us’d in outward
          <lb/>Impostumes. They are of no Effect in those Tumors
          <lb/>call'd Meliceris, Steatoma, Atheroma, and Talpa. They are
          <lb/>also mischievous in Consumptions attended with a rapid Motion
          <lb/>os the Blood, and weak pulmonary Veffeis, and in too copious
          <lb/>Perspiration. Os, in a Word, where-ever strengthening and
          <lb/>bracing up the Solids, and thickening and cooling the Fluids, are
          <lb/>indicated, these Waters must be refrain'd from. Or where the
          <lb/>animal Secretions are to be lessen’d.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Hence observe the following Mistakes in the Use of these
          <lb/>Waters: First, Does their chief Efficacy depend on their volatile
          <lb/>Parts, which only consist of a Steam or Vapour; and are they
          <lb/>hetter adapted to Diseases of the smaller than of the' larger Vessels
          <lb/>? Then it is an Error to imagine, that all the Bufiness is
          <lb/>done by drinking large Quantities of them, and so turning them
          <lb/>to evacuants, at least powerful Diuretics ; whereby they are
          <lb/>hurry'd out of. the Body before they heve done their Work,
          <lb/>which lies in much smaller Vessels, and requires longer Retention.
          <lb/>Secondly, IS Evacuation inconsistent with all the intentions
          <lb/>os the Waters ? Then how imprudent are those who use
          <lb/>evacuant Medicines along with the Waters, whether Purgatives
          <lb/>or Diuretics, which expeditioufly carry <hi>off</hi> the Waters,
          <lb/>and, together with them, the thinner Parts of the’Blood, out of
          <lb/>the larger Veffeis, and the Lymph, which is pour'd into the
          <lb/>chylopoetic Organs for diluting the Chyle I But allow they
          <lb/>should drink so much more Water in proportion to the Increase
          <lb/>os the Drains : In this mending the Matter, and not making
          <lb/>it worse ? For hereby there is a greater Pressure and Quantity of
          <lb/>-Water laid upon the Intestines, or Organs destin'd for. the Secretion
          <lb/>of the Urine, the Fluids in these Glands thinn'd, and
          <lb/>their excretory Ducts widen'd and laid more open, and all
          <lb/>every way fitted for a larger and freer Vent of the more serous
          <lb/>Parts os the Blood, which should dilute: the grosser in the smallest
          <lb/>Vessels. Hence Obstructions are more riveted there, or at
          <lb/>least not removed,<space type="tab"> </space>. ἐν ’ ...</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thirdly, Does the Water heat and rarefy the Blood.?-It it
          <lb/>then rational to send young Persons thither, especially in the
          <lb/>Heat of Summer, whose Blood is capable of Rarefaction, .when
          <lb/>the Warmth of the Water, by the Presence -os its mineral
          <lb/>Principle, join'd to the Heat of the Blood, and the het Season,
          <lb/>has relax'd the Solids, and widen'd the Vessels, and the Blood is
          <lb/>in its greatest natural Rarefaction? One would think this Caution
          <lb/>needless, to fuch especially as consider the fatal Consequences
          <lb/>of a Very rarefied State of the Air, by Lightning, to
          <lb/>animal Bedies ; for the Atmosphere heing suddenly raresy'd by
          <lb/>the Flash, the sudden Expansion of the Air in the Blood, to a
          <lb/>-Balance with this Atmosphere,, quickly bursts the Vessels,
          <lb/>mingles Solids and Fluids together, asina Mortification ; and
          <lb/>the hardest Parts, which give the' greatest Resistance to this Violent
          <lb/>expansion, are burst into a thousand Pieces, the Spring of
          <lb/>' .the Air being so much superior to the Cohefion-os the Parch.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Fourthly, Does the Water rarefy the Blood ? Them how in.consistent
          <lb/>is violent Exercise with, their Use, as Dancing and
          <lb/>Revelling to unseasonable Hours, strong Bowling in'the Heat
          <lb/>of the Day, galloping on Horseback, instead of and easy Trot,
          <lb/>or an ambling Pace l These Violent Exercises heat, the Blond
          <lb/>too much, and are often of bad Consequences. Fifthly, Is the
          <lb/>Design of this Water Relaxation and Dilution ?- Then hew do
          <lb/>such promote these Ends, who. deal all: the while in Dramas
          <lb/>Spirits, and.Punch, all which contract andsurivel up the Solids,
          <lb/>at.the first two Very remarkably coagulate the Fluids f Sixthly,
          <lb/>Do the Waters rarefy the Blood,: and.increase its Bulk-and Motion
          <lb/>? And is it safe and ad viseable for-those whohave a natural
          <lb/>Fuiness or Superfluity of the Juices, or for such as heve naturally
          <lb/>a quick Pulse, large Secretions, thin Bodies, and weak
          <lb/>Vessels ? For once more give me Leave to say, that these
          <lb/>Waters are not to be trifled with ; fince, if their Use is not
          <lb/>wanted, and does no Good, they certainly do Mischief; and
          <lb/>whoever says the contrary. Votes these Waters good for littie or
          <lb/>" nothing; and, if he understands the Waters rightly, may as
          <lb/>'well advise the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark in continual Fevers, or during
          <lb/>the Fit of Intermittents, or Steel Medicines in a Plethora, or
          <lb/>Sugar os'Lead in a Dropsy or Palsy, or Camphine in the Declination
          <lb/>of a hot Fever, which has parched up and dried the
          <lb/>Body, and almost worn out the Spring of the Vessels. But,
          <lb/>seventhly. Are these Waters warm, and impregnated with a</p>
        <p>very volatile penetrating Part, wherein lies their chiefest Essi-.
          <lb/>cacy ? And is this Principle gone when they are cold .? Then
          <lb/>they must he drank warm at the Spring to answer any End ;
          <lb/>sor, when they are cold, they only serve instead os common
          <lb/>Water, heing purer and hetter than that. Eighthly, is the
          <lb/>Nature of these Waters relaxing and attenuating? Then specialCare
          <lb/>must be taken, that a suitable Diet, heth in Meat and Drink,
          <lb/>he observ'd, and that the Patient refrain from every’ thing that
          <lb/>is opposite to their Use, and gave Birth to his Distemper, tho'
          <lb/>never so much his Favourite, and seemingly opposite to Nature.
          <lb/>Ninthly, Is the chief Design of these Waters Relaxation and
          <lb/>Dilution? Then are they improper in Obstructions from a Siziness
          <lb/>os the Juices, and a Relaxation os the Vessels, as in Caehexies
          <lb/>and Dropsies. Tenthly, But, say some prejudic'd Persons,
          <lb/>is you can find out the Nature os this Mineral Spirit, in
          <lb/>which you. assert the Efficacy os these Waters to consist, why
          <lb/>may they not he imitated, and so People sav'd much Labour,
          <lb/>and Loss os Time, and Expences? Answer. First, Imitate it
          <lb/>with what ? Whether with fix'd or volatile Bodies ? Where
          <lb/>will you furnish me with Matter divided into, and existing in,
          <lb/>such small, subtile, incoercible Particles ? Or where is the Art
          <lb/>that can reduce Mineral Substances to such a volatile, fugitive.
          <lb/>Mineral Spirit, a Spirit that cannot be retain'd .? A Substance os
          <lb/>almost as minute Parts as those of Light and Heat ? A Steam
          <lb/>fitted to pass the smallest Crannies in Nature ? But, secondly.
          <lb/>So exquisite is the Mixture, and so great the Difference between
          <lb/>divine and human Compositions, that the former are inimitable.
          <lb/>What. Anatomist, that knows the Structure of a human Body
          <lb/>the best, will undertake to make another like it ? Or what
          <lb/>Chymist, that can separate the Principles of a Plant to the
          <lb/>greatest Exactness, will yet have Assurance to boast os his Ca.*
          <lb/>pacity so sar, as to reunite even the same Parts again, in the
          <lb/>same Form and Condition, with a vegetable Life? Even .io
          <lb/>different are the'Compofitions of God and Man. Hence we
          <lb/>see, that he who made these Bedies and Veffeis at first, is
          <lb/>best able tojudge os their Diameters, and knows best how to
          <lb/>prepare Substances suited to their Dimensions and Diseases.
          <lb/>Therefore, could we pretend to mimic these Waters, yet the
          <lb/>Counterfeit would he so much, inferior to the Natural, as a
          <lb/>Piece, of Painting, tho' never so fine, is to the Original Life.

        <p rend="indent"><hi>Box</hi> seldom grows to he a Tree of any great Bigness; in <hi>England</hi>’,
          <lb/>the Wood is hard, solid, and ponderous, of a yellow
          <lb/>Colour, cover'd with a whitish Bark. The Leaves are small
          <lb/>and roundish, of a firm Texture,' and a shining green Colour ;
          <lb/>it is perennial, keeping always green: The Flowers are small,
          <lb/>of a yellowish Colour, each composed of five Leaves. The
          <lb/>Fruit is small, roundish, and tricapsular, with three Points or
          <lb/>Horns on the Top. It grows wild in some Parts <hi>as Kent</hi> and
          <lb/><hi>Surry</hi>, as about ὰδοκἤιΖΖ near <hi>Darkiag. Miller's Bot. Osse</hi>.</p>
        <p>The Leaves of the <hi>Eox</hi> are bitter, have an ill Smell, and

          <lb/>yery much for the Epilepsy, the Vapours, and the Tooth-acb.
          <lb/>Being rectified, and circulated afterwards with a third Part of

          <lb/>some, from the Wood distil an Oise which is highly
          <lb/>narcotic, and which they wonderfully extol in Epilepsies, Toothachs,
          <lb/>and Rottenness of the Teeth. He also telis us, that <hi>Fernelius</hi>

          <lb/>Box heve heen boil’d, not only makes the Hairs grow, but also
          <lb/>gives them a yellowish Colour. A Decoction of the Flowers of
          <lb/>Box is by some said to be sudorific; and others inform us, that

          <lb/>used a Decoction of this Wood, more than once, with wonderful
          <lb/>Success. The same Author, <hi>Cent</hi>. 3. <hi>Cur</hi>. 36. by a Decoction
          <lb/>of Box-woed, aster all other Medicines hed proved ineffectual,
          <lb/>in the. Space os twenty Days cured an <hi>Hemicrania,</hi>
          <lb/>brought on by a Consent of the Parts. A Decoction os the
          <lb/>Wood, in Red-wine, has by some heen sound to do great Service
          <lb/>in Tooth-achs arising from cold Defiukions. Besides, a
          <lb/>singular anodyne Quality is ascribed to the Wood, for which
          <lb/>Reason many recommend Tooth-pickers made of it. The Oil
          <lb/>also, distil'd from the Box-wood, is accounted excellent against
          <lb/>the Tooth-ach, Fevers, Vertigoes, the Falling-sickness, find
          <lb/>the Haemorrhoids, <hi>Schulzii Prcelectiones</hi>, and <hi>Simon Paulliscs
          <lb/>Ssuadripartitum Botanicum</hi>. The Wood alone, subjected to
          <lb/>Distillation from a Retort in a Sand-heat, yields an acid Spirit,
          <lb/>and a fetid empyreumatio Oil,' just like those yielded by Guaiacword;
          <lb/>when treated in a like manner. That this acid Spinis,
          <lb/>when rectified, dissolves Coral, and produces other Effects,
          <lb/>which prove the Similarity of its Nature to that, of penetrating
          <lb/>Acids, may be seen in <hi>Boflests Chyrnifla Scepiicus</hi>. If this em~
          <lb/>PyreumaticOil, which is by some thought to be the <hi>Oleum Heraclium</hi>
          <lb/>of <hi>Rulandus</hi>, is put into the Hollow of a carious Tooth;
          <lb/>and applied immediately to the Nerves-, it removes the Toothach,
          <lb/>by burning them, just like Oil of Cloves, or any other
          <lb/>acrid and caustic Oils. When mix'd with melted Butter, it is
          <lb/>recommended to be used by way of Liniment in Cancers;. and,
          <lb/>when mix’d with Oil of St. John’s Wort, it is used in the
          <lb/>same Form in the Rheumatism and Gout. But if it is rectified,
          <lb/>and digested for some time, with a third Part of good Spirit of
          <lb/>Wine, it affords an anodyne and aperient Medicine for internal
          <lb/>Uses, of which fifteen or twenty Drops may be exhibited with
          <lb/>Sugar or Liquorice-powder. The Smoak of the kindled Boxwood
          <lb/>seems to be justly recommended against the Plague, not
          <lb/>sh much on account of its highly fetid Smell, which at once induced
          <lb/><hi>Bauhine</hi> to the Affirmative, as hecause it abounds with
          <lb/>an acid Salt, which, when drawn in with the Air, resists that
          <lb/>Putrefaction of the Juices, to which, during the Time of the
          <lb/>Plague, they are always disposed. It is worth while to inquire
          <lb/>into the Origin of the Persuasion of some, that the Virtues of
          <lb/>the Box-tree may not only contribute to extinguish the Sense of
          <lb/>.Venereal Pleasures, but also to banish the Devil himself. All
          <lb/>fetid Substances, then, possess a Power of stimulating the
          <lb/>-Nerves into Motion, removing the disorderly Sallies of the animal
          <lb/>Spirits, and consequently of curing those hysteric Indispositions
          <lb/>produced by such a Cause. Now, hypochondriac and
          <lb/>hysteric Passions are generally attended with surprising spasmodic
          <lb/>Motions, by ignorant People ascribed to the <hi>Devil</hi>, and his
          <lb/>Influence on the human Body; but the Box-tree is possess'd of
          <lb/>a Quality capable of removing these Disorders, and their concomitant
          <lb/>Symptoms. Therefore, fay they, it banishes the Devil,
          <lb/>whom they as salfly as foolishly suppose to he the immediate
          <lb/>Author of these Symptoms.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is also possible, that this Persuasion of the Power of the
          <lb/>Box-woed to banish the Devil may heve been owing to a Custom
          <lb/>of consecrating its Leaves on <hi>Palm-sunday</hi> in some Countries
          <lb/>; where, at that Season, no other Leaves are to he found :
          <lb/>Whether it is really so Or not, 'tis nevertheless certain, that,
          <lb/>from this .Circumstance, -the <hi>Dutch</hi>' call the Box-tree <hi>Palmboom</hi>,
          <lb/>and its Wood <hi>Palrnndjout</hi>. I must not, on this Occasion,
          <lb/>forget a Story told by <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> in these Words: " I am
          <lb/>" acquainted, fays he, with a certain Priest in our own Coun"

          <lb/>" ter, performing at the same time a certain ridiculous Exor"
          <lb/>cism. All this Apparatus, as he told the By-standerS, was
          <lb/>/<hi rend="sup">c</hi> to remove the Fever, and dislodge the Worms with which
          <lb/>" the Boy was afflicted. Soon after, indeed, the Fever was
          <lb/>** carried off, but the Patient unluckily died ; upon which I
          <lb/>" advised my Countryman Io heware of the like Practice, for</p>
        <p rend="indent">the future; fince the Leaves of the Box-tree are possess'd of

        <p rend="indent">The <hi>Caa-apia Pisonis, Histor. Brasilians. Cda-api Brasiliensibus
          <lb/>dicta, G. Marcgravii</hi>, is a small low Plant, with a
          <lb/>Root about a Finger's Breadth or two long, as thick as a Swan’s
          <lb/>Quill, and sometimes as large as one's little Finger. This Root
          <lb/>is knotty, and has its Sides, and its Extremity, furnish'd with
          <lb/>Filaments three or four Fingers Breadths in Length. It is of a
          <lb/>yellowish-grey Colour externally, but white internally. It is
          <lb/>insipid when first put into the Mouth, but afterwards discovers
          <lb/>a Taste somewhat acrid and pungent.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From this Root arise three or four Stalks or Pedicles, which
          <lb/>are stender, round, and three or four Finger-breadths in Length.
          <lb/>Each of these Pedicles bears a Leaf, about a Finger-breadth in
          <lb/>Broadness, and three or sour Finger-breadths in Length. This
          <lb/>Leaf is of a shining-green Colour on the superior, but a little
          <lb/>whitish on the inferior Side. It is furnish'd with a Nerve
          <lb/>throughout its whole Length, and intersected with small rising
          <lb/>Veins on its inferior Side</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Flower has a Pedicle peculiar to itself, and is round,
          <lb/>' radiated, and resembling thet of the Bellis. It is composed of
          <lb/>several Stamina, and bears round Seeds smaller than those of
          <lb/>Mustard. - .</p>

          <lb/>receive the greater Light, with regard to the Truth of this Assertion,
          <lb/>and be enabled to form a juster Judgment of the Medicinal
          <lb/>Virtues of <hi>Chocolate</hi>, of which this <hi>Nut</hi> is the Basis, we

        <p rend="indent">Two Pounds, then, of crude Cacao yielded various Liquors,
          <lb/>mix'd with an acid and acrid Salt; that is, fourteen Ounces and
          <lb/>an half, and half a Dram of Oil, and half an Ounce and ten
          <lb/>Grains of a lixivia! Salt. <hi>Du Hamel Hist</hi>, and <hi>Hist. Ac. R. Sc.</hi>

          <lb/>hy Mr. <hi>Hornberg</hi>, separated from the rest, in three different
          <lb/>Manners: First, by Distillation, he obtain'd from one Pound
          <lb/>of <hi>Cacao</hi> three Ounces and a Quarter of Oil, which is much
          <lb/>about the fifth Part os a Pound. Secondly, from one Pound of
          <lb/>the <hi>Cacao</hi>, made hot, and bruis'd in the ordinary Manner, he
          <lb/>obtain'd, by Expression, two Ounces of Oil; and from the
          <lb/>Fences, afterwards, boil'd in Water, he expressed half an
          <lb/>Ounce of a like Oil; from the same Foeces, mix'd.with common
          <lb/>Water, and subjected to Distillation, he obtain'd two</p>
        <p>Ounces and an half more; so that She whole Oil, obtained,
          <lb/>amounted to five Ounces and an half Lastly, grinding the
          <lb/><hi>Cacao</hi> with a warm Stone, as when the Chocolate is prepar'd of
          <lb/>it, he mix'd thirteen Ounces of this subdu'd Mass with eight
          <lb/>Pounds of boiling Water, which, when cold, exhibited no
          <lb/>kind of pinguious Substance on its Surface. But after this
          <lb/>Matter, put into the Water, was hell'd, and inspissated to the
          <lb/>Consistence of a thick PoultiS, then a pinguious Substance was
          <lb/>observ'd to float on the Surface, which, being collected by littie
          <lb/>and littie, till no more appear'd, became gradually so thick and
          <lb/>tenacious, that it could not commodiousiy be handled with a
          <lb/>Spoon, and was, at last, indurated like Tallow, but retain'd
          <lb/>the Smell of the <hi>Cacao</hi>. Six Ounces and somewhat more of this
          <lb/>Fat were taken off, and, by Distillation, the Foeces yielded an
          <lb/>Ounce and three Drams more ; so that from thirteen Ounces of
          <lb/>the Mass seven Ounces and three Drams of Oil and Fat were,
          <lb/>by this Method, extracted. The Reason of this Difference,
          <lb/>according to the Conjecture of Mr. <hi>Homberg</hi>, is, that the
          <lb/><hi>Cacao</hi> brought from the <hi>Indies</hi>, being much dry’d, and long
          <lb/>kept, loses much of that native Humour, from which Part of
          <lb/>the Fat is obtain'd. For this Reason, when put into the Retort
          <lb/>dry, in the first Analysis, by a simple Distillation, it yields
          <lb/>little Oil; but, in the second Operation, the Fat being separated
          <lb/>by Expression, and the Foeces being impregnated with
          <lb/>warm Water, the pinguious Matter remaining in the Fences,
          <lb/>and which had, by being too much dry’d, lost a Part of its
          <lb/>Moisture, recovers it again, and then yields as much Oil by
          <lb/>Distillation, as it had before done by Expression. In the third
          <lb/>Process, after a large Quantity of Water had been added to the
          <lb/><hi>Cacao</hi>, reduc'd to a kind of Mass, and, aster they had boil'd
          <lb/>together, on a gentie Fire, sor five or six Hours, the pinguious
          <lb/>Particles heing, by this time, sufficiently impregnated with
          <lb/>Moisture, united, and thus, by this Method, more than three
          <lb/>times aS much Oil was extracted, as was obtain’d by the fust
          <lb/>Distillation. <hi>Hansel Hist</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>Ray</hi> gives us the following Analysis of <hi>Cacao-nuts</hi> : Eight
          <lb/>Ounces, says he, of undecorticated Cacao-nuts, reduc'd to a
          <lb/>Powder, and committed to the Retort, discover'd themselves
          <lb/>to he of a Substance so fix'd and dissicultiy resoluble, that, by a
          <lb/>moderate Fine, they yielded nothing but a small Quantity of a
          <lb/>certain whitish Liquor, clear and transpurent like Water, and
          <lb/>which tyas taken for Phlegm. Then, increasing the Fire to
          <lb/>that Degree which is requisite sor extracting the Spirit os Vitriol,
          <lb/>in the Space of seventeen Hours, there was a Spirit rais'd in tho
          <lb/>Form os Exhalations, of a milky Whiteness. This Spirit, contrary
          <lb/>to the Custom os all others, subsided in Phlegm to the
          <lb/>Bottom of the Receiver.. At last, upon the Application of the
          <lb/>most Violent reverberating Heat, a Practice not usual in the
          <lb/>Distillation of Vegetables, there ascended an Oil highly red,
          <lb/>and, aS it were, of a Blood .colour, but, at the same time,
          <lb/>pretty transparent. This Oil, when cold, thickens like other
          <lb/>Oil, or like Butter of Wax; the Caput Mortuum weighed
          <lb/>two Ounces seven Drams, the Spirit two Ounces, the Oil
          <lb/>three Ounces and a half. The Spirit was not Very hot, but
          <lb/>highly penetrating, neither was it ungrateful to the Smell, as
          <lb/>those Spirits generally are which ure drawn from Blood or Flesh.
          <lb/>The Oil is, in like manner, wonderfully pungent and penetrating,
          <lb/>before it is separated from the Volatile Salt, of which it
          <lb/>contains a large Quantity ; it is also highly aromatic and cordial.
          <lb/>The Spirit soon becomes acid, a Circumstance which
          <lb/>sufficiently proves, that it contains a great deal of an acid Principle.
          <lb/>From what has been said, 'tis obvious, that the <hi>Cacao</hi>
          <lb/>contains a large Quantity of Oil, and this Oil is found, from.
          <lb/>Experience, to be highly excellent sor some Medicinal Purposes,
          <lb/>when it is neither alter'd by Distillation, nor spoilin by Express
          <lb/>sion, but obtain'd pure, only by boiling in Water. For this
          <lb/>Reason the <hi>Okum e Nuclais Cacao</hi> is one of the Oils in the
          <lb/><hi>Pharmac.. Paris</hi>. For obtaining this Oil, the Nuts, when
          <lb/>roasted, and clear'd of their Hulks and Buds, are levigated upon
          <lb/>a Stone with Fire under it,, and then boil'd in Water, till the
          <lb/>Oil appears on the Surface, which, when the Water is cold,
          <lb/>may be gathered from it concreted and thick like Suet, of a
          <lb/>brownish Colour, which is chang'd into that of white, by
          <lb/>washing it with warm Water whilst liquid. But it seems to he
          <lb/>a preferable Method, by which the Oil is extracted from the
          <lb/>Nuts by boiling, aster having taken off their Husks and Buds,
          <lb/>and bruis'd them without roasting them. Sixteen Ounces of
          <lb/>the Nuts, thus treated, yielded three Ounces and an half of a
          <lb/>very beautiful Butter,. of a white Colour, with a Cast of
          <lb/>green and yellow. This Butter, as to its Consistence, had
          <lb/>a nearer Resemblance to Suet than to Oil ; but it had a most
          <lb/>fragrant and delicious Taste. <hi>Comm. Lit</hi>. for the Year I737.
          <lb/>From its Consistence it is call'd <hi>Butyrum Cacao</hi>, or Butter of
          <lb/>Cacao. In <hi>America</hi> this native Oil, when separated and pure,
          <lb/>is said to have no Smell, but a pretty grateful Taste. 'Tis also
          <lb/>said, that, in Process of Time, it acquires the Consistence of
          <lb/>Cheese, which may be kept for a long time without becoming
          <lb/>rancid or corrupted, and which may afterwards be liquified
          <lb/>with a Very gentie Heat. A certain Quantity of this Oil,
          <lb/>distil'd from a Cucurbit, plac’d in the Heat of Ashes, yielded </p>

          <lb/>of the Receiver a few Drops of a olear Liquor, of a somewhat
          <lb/>acid, and highly grateful. Taste. This Butter of Cacao, when
          <lb/>not rectify’^, may not only supply the Place of the best Oil of
          <lb/>Olives in Food, but ’tis alio extol’d as a highly anodyne Medicine,
          <lb/>and proper for correcting the acrimonious Humours
          <lb/>which prove uneasy to the <hi>Afpera 'Arteria</hi>. The Method of
          <lb/>using it is, to make it up into Troches with Sugar-candy, to

          <lb/>are also much reliev’d by being anointed with it, when reduc’d

          <lb/>mix’d with Powder of Millepedes, Sacctiarum Saturni, Pompholyx,

          <lb/>Parts affeoled with arthritic Pains, applying a warm Cloth over
          <lb/>It. It is also recommended as a proper Basis for the apoplectic
          <lb/>Balsams; and may be substituted, if not preferr’d, to the Oil of
          <lb/>Nutmegs. It is allo highly proper for anointing instruments of
          <lb/>Steel or Iron, in order to preserve them from Rust. In <hi>America</hi>
          <lb/>the Women use it for rendering the Skin smooth and even,
          <lb/>without leaving any shining uperuous Gloss behind it. But
          <lb/>since, in <hi>Europe</hi>, it is of too firm and hard a Consistence for
          <lb/>this Purpofe, it may be mix’d with Oil of Ben, or with Oll of
          <lb/>sweet Almonds, express’d without Fire. Where the Butter of

          <lb/>’tis to be dreaded lest it prove of too bard Digestion, and bring

          <lb/>an Account of a Woman, who, after a <hi>Haemoptoe</hi>, became

          <lb/>and Loss of Appetite ; to which, on the ninth and tenth Days,
          <lb/>were added Weaknesses, and paintings; and, upon injecting
          <lb/>a Clyster, the Patient discharg’d indurated Globules, of a

        <p rend="indent">But the Circumstance which, of all others, renders the
          <lb/>Cacao-nut most celebrated, is, its being the Basis of Chocolate,
          <lb/>a factitious Substance, first brought from <hi>America</hi>, into <hi>Europe,</hi>
          <lb/>by the <hi>Spaniarde</hi>, about the Beginning of the last Century. It
          <lb/>is a solid Mass, form’d either into round or fquare Plates, or
          <lb/>made up into Cylinders of a dark-brown Colour. This Substance
          <lb/>is friable, and, for the most part, of a grateful arornatio
          <lb/>Smell. It is sometimes dissolv’d in Watet, sometimes in Wine,
          <lb/>and sometimes in Milk; at other times Sis eaten dry, or mix’d
          <lb/>with other Food. It is drank either with a View to nourish,
          <lb/>or regale the Stomach, to provoke to Venery,' or to answer
          <lb/>some Medicinal Intention. The Effects of Chocolate on our
          <lb/>Bodies, whether produc’d by its nutritive or stimulating Quality,
          <lb/>ought to be determin’d from a joint Consideration of the aromatic
          <lb/>Ingredients which enter its Composition, and of the Natore
          <lb/>of the Liquor in which it is dissolv’d for Use. Its nutritive
          <lb/>Quality is diminish’d by the Addition of a large Quantity
          <lb/>of Aromatics, since by thet means it becomes too hot. It is
          <lb/>else too hot when dissolv’d in Wine, except in those remote
          <lb/>Northerly Regions, where the Inhabitants are accustom’d to a
          <lb/>hot Regimen. When prepar’d with Milk, it nourishes more
          <lb/>than in any other Form ; but it - seems, at the same time, to
          <lb/>load the Stomach too much. By the Addition of an Egg or
          <lb/>two, which is the Custom with feme People, its nutritive
          <lb/>Quaility is augmented. Water, therefore, seems, of all others,
          <lb/>to be the best Vehicle for Chocolate, since, by its Dilution, it
          <lb/>must, of course, promote the Distribution of its nutritive Principles.
          <lb/>in the hotter Countries of <hi>Europe</hi>, it is generally prepar’d
          <lb/>with Water; and, because it is drank hot, and must, os
          <lb/>courfe, relax the Tone of the Stomach, it is customary to take
          <lb/>a Draught os cold Water either before or after it, with a View
          <lb/>to assist the Contraction of the Stomach. The <hi>Americans</hi>
          <lb/>drink Chocolate, as a Cooler, at their Feasts and Entertainments.
          <lb/>Many also of the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> drink it, cool’d with
          <lb/>Ice or Snow. Chocolate is particularly proper for cold Constitutions,
          <lb/>for old People, for such as have their Strength impair’d
          <lb/>by continual Watchings, and for those whetravel in cold
          <lb/>Mornings. It is also, by some, commended in Cases where
          <lb/>the Digestion is weak ; but the <hi>Cacao-nut</hi> is of too oily and
          <lb/>tenacious a Nature, to be digested by a weak Stomach. For
          <lb/>which Reason <hi>Cheyne</hi> thinks, that the Weak and infirm should
          <lb/>Dot use it, either as Food, or as a Medicine; but rather recommends
          <lb/>to them, for common Food, farinaceous Substances,
          <lb/>such as Pease, Beans, Millet, Oats, Barley, Rice, Wheat,
          <lb/>and other Substances of a like Nature, host’d in Water or Milk,
          <lb/>but he owns, that Chocolate may produce all the salutary Effects
          <lb/>of a whossotne Food, in vigorous and robust Constitutions;
          <lb/>in which it may allo bo us’d, as an anodyne Medicine, in Colles,
          <lb/>and Nephritic Pains, since, by its Viscidity, it sheaths
          <lb/>up and blunts the salt, acrid, and irritating Humours, that</p>

          <lb/>substitute other acrid Aromatics,. such as Pepper, Ginger,
          <lb/>and others of a like Nature; The most simple of all the Methods
          <lb/>of preparing Chocolate used in <hi>Europe</hi>, is directed in the
          <lb/><hi>Pharmacap. Augustan, thus</hi>:</p>
        <p rend="indent">Take CacaoNuts, gentiy roasted, decorticated, and.reduced
          <lb/>' to a fine Powder ; let two Parts of this Powder be reduced
          <lb/>to a Paste, with one Part of white Sugar, and dry'd in a
          <lb/>gentie Heat.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Whoever has a mind to inform himself more stilly of the various
          <lb/>Ingredients.used in preparing Chocolate, let him consult
          <lb/><hi>Meisucr, Caldera, Du-Four</hi>, and Pise. As for the Goodness
          <lb/>of the Chocolate commonly sold, that is generally thought best
          <lb/>which is intirely dissolved in the.Liquor with which it is made,
          <lb/>without leaving any Sediment. Th <hi>Spain</hi> the Chocolate is
          <lb/>thought heft which is pierc'd by Worms, who are said to he
          <lb/>fond of none hut what is good. <hi>Saaumur. sc</hi>. ί .</p>
        <p rend="indent">It now remains, thet we say something con<hi rend="u">cernin</hi>g the Mejhod
          <lb/><hi>of</hi> reducing Chocolate to a proper Liquor for drinking.
          <lb/>The most ordinary manner os doing this is to put.heiling Water,
          <lb/>or, in its stead, .Milk or Wine, in a proper Vessel; then
          <lb/>the Chocolate, being cut down,. is added to the Liquor; and,
          <lb/>during the boiling, the Mixture is well agitated with a denticulated
          <lb/>or notchedPiece os Wood,; commonly called a <hi>Mill</hi>, 'till
          <lb/>it froths; then the frothy Liquor is poured into-a Cup or. Bowl,
          <lb/>and drank warm or tepid. Tt is also a Custom with many to
          <lb/>eat toasted Bread or Biscuit soak’d in lit. What remains of the
          <lb/>Liquor is, before it is poured into the second or third Cups, to
          <lb/>he again agitated as before, till sat last the Whole, is converted
          <lb/>into Froth.' Some allow the Chocolate to boil shr some time
          <lb/>with the Liquor, hesore .they attempt to raise fit into a Froth.
          <lb/>But 'tis to be Tear'd, that, hy this Method, it !may lose too
          <lb/>much of the subtile Aromatic it contains. They who do mot
          <lb/>think the Chocolate before sufficiently impregnated with Sugar,
          <lb/>add of that Ingredient whatever they, have a mind.. The Proportion
          <lb/>of-the Chocolate to the Liquor, with regard to Weight,
          <lb/>ought, according to <hi>Mundius</hi>, and some other Authors, to-he
          <lb/>as one to eight. But the Proportion is always varied, according
          <lb/>as the Chocolate is wanted strong or weak.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As for the Dose or Quantity of Chocolate to he drank at a
          <lb/>time, it is commonly determined by the Person who drinks it.
          <lb/><hi>Colmenero de Ledefma</hi>, a celebrated <hi>Spaniard</hi>, affirms, that between
          <lb/>five and six Ounces of it may he drank, without doing any
          <lb/>Injury to the Constitution. And that larger Quantities’are not
          <lb/>prejudicial to such as are not accustomed to it, is plain, from daily</p>
        <p>Experience, especially in Cases where the Stomach becoming
          <lb/>empty requires fresh Supplies. <hi>‘They</hi> who drink the gross Substance
          <lb/>which subsides to the Bottom, imagining it to be the most
          <lb/>nutritive Part os the Chocolate, are grofly mistaken, and by
          <lb/>that Practice considerably injure their Health ; since, according
          <lb/>to the last quoted Author, it is only the terrestrial Part os the
          <lb/><hi>Cacao</hi>, which, by creating Obstructions, disposes to melancholic
          <lb/>Disorders. The Dose or Quantity must also be constderably
          <lb/>Varied, according to the Strength or Weakness of the
          <lb/>Chocolate, and according as it is made with Milk or Wine. A
          <lb/>Man in perfect Health may drink as much as he has an Appetite
          <lb/>for, provided he finds himself refresh'd, and his Stomach not
          <lb/>overloaded by it. But he ought to remain in a State of Rest
          <lb/>for half an Hour, or an Hour, after he has drank it, lest Concoction
          <lb/>and Digestion should he interrupted, or irregularly carried
          <lb/>on. He ought also to abstain from Food for some time aster
          <lb/>he has drank Chocolate, lest by a contrary Practice he should
          <lb/>injure his Stomach ; for Chocolate is itself Very good Matter of
          <lb/>Nourishment. For this Reason the most proper Time sor usings
          <lb/>it is when the Concoction- is finish'd, whether in the Morning,
          <lb/>or in the Afternoon. And since in a hot Air the Powers of
          <lb/>Digestion are fainter and more languid than in a cold State of
          <lb/>the Atmosphere, 'tis hence obvious, thet Chocolate ought to be
          <lb/>used in smaller Quantities, and less frequently, in Summer than
          <lb/>in Winter, as <hi>Colmenero</hi> has justly advised ; though he adds,
          <lb/>" That in <hi>Amerioagi</hi> and eVen in <hi>Spain</hi>, Chocolate may be
          <lb/>" drank at all times ; and that this is owing, first, to Custom J. "
          <lb/>and, fecondsy, to the excessive Heat of these Countries, by
          <lb/>winch, in Conjunction with an abundant Humidity, the
          <lb/><hi rend="sup">6C</hi> Pores of the Inhabitants are- open'd, and a great Dissipation
          <lb/>“ of the Substance os the Body is caused ; so that Chocolate
          <lb/>" may there be safely drank, not only in the Morning, but at
          <lb/><hi>" any</hi> Hour of the Day. Now; fince by the intense Heat the
          <lb/>" natural Heat of the Body is dissipated; and since the Heat of
          <lb/>" the Stomach, and other Viscera, retires to the Circumor
          <lb/>ference of the Body, the Stomach must of course he Ten"
          <lb/>dered considerably weakened ; so that the <hi>Americans</hi> and <hi>Spa"
          <lb/>niards</hi> find themselves refresh'd, and the Tone of their Sto"
          <lb/>machs restor'd, not only by Chocolate, hut also by pure
          <lb/>" and unadulterated Wine." The aromatic Ingredients os
          <lb/>the Chocolate recruit the languid Stomach; as also generous
          <lb/>Wine, by restoring a due Degree of Contraction to the nervous
          <lb/>System, and raising the Spirits to a proper Motion: But lest,
          <lb/>in Consequence of a Dissipation of the aqueous Liquids, the
          <lb/>parched Vesseis of the Body should receive a Heat which would
          <lb/>farther inflame the Humours; to the no small Detriment of
          <lb/>Health, <hi>Caldera</hi> advises, " That if, during an excessive Heat,
          <lb/>" the Person who intends to drink Chocolate is thirsty, he
          <lb/>" should a little hesore take a small Draught of cold water,
          <lb/><hi>or lest</hi> the Chocolate produce a fresh Degree of Thirst, and ren"
          <lb/>der it more intense than it was before. But any Liquor
          <lb/><hi>" drank</hi> after Chocolate generally produces the most terrible
          <lb/>" Symptoms, whether it he Wine or Water. I myself saw a
          <lb/>." Vertigo produc'd by this imprudent Practice in a Citizen of
          <lb/><hi>" Seville</hi>; the Colic in another ; and a Privation of Voice in or
          <lb/>many others." Physicians are not fully agreed, whether
          <lb/>without any Prejudice to Health cold Chocolate may he used aS
          <lb/>a Cooler. Ginge affirms, " That it is so excessively cold, that
          <lb/>" sew can ufe it safely ; fince it excites Pains of the Stomach,
          <lb/>and other Disorders, especially in Women." According to</p>
        <p><hi>Caldera</hi>, when this Liquor is cooled with Ice or Snow, it is
          <lb/>.equally Virulent and dangerous with cold Poisons: For, says he,
          <lb/>when a sudden Cold seizes the Organs of Respiration, it affects
          <lb/>.them with such a Numbness and Torpor, that they can no
          <lb/>longer perform then proper Motions , and this Motion ceasing,
          <lb/>a sudden Death ensues. -Now 'tis evident, not only from Reason,
          <lb/>shut from daily Experience, that the same fatal Conse. <hi rend="sup">s</hi>.
          <lb/>quences must be produced, when at. intense and preternatural</p>
        <p>Cold has seiz'd the Stomach, the Liver, the Uterus, and the
          <lb/>extremeOrifices os she Veins; because such a Cold, by ohis</p>
        <p>structing these Orifices, puts a Stop :to the Circulation- of the*
          <lb/>: Blood, .which in this Case is so Coagulated in the Extremities of
          <lb/>» she Veins, that the Functions of Lise cease. Syncopes ensue,.</p>
        <p>iand rhe Patient dies suddenly, without any apparent Cause.
          <lb/>To such as object, that .all who dally drink Chocolate thus
          <lb/>.cool'd -do not die suddenly, <hi>Caldera</hi> makes this Reply, That
          <lb/>neither do ail who are seiz'd with a Plague die of it ; hecause,
          <lb/>though -the <hi>Pomes</hi> Os this Disease jo an Agent of wonderful
          <lb/>-Force and Efficacy, yet it only operates on Subjects properly
          <lb/>.disposed sor yielding to its Virulence; so that every one ought
          <lb/>Io take cure of himself, and become cautious, by an Observa..
          <lb/>aion os the Fates of others. <hi>Colmenero</hi>, according to <hi>Meisucr,</hi>
          <lb/>as of Opinion, thatChocolate drank in the Dog-days by People
          <lb/>osthot Constitutions, and fuch aS are afflicted with a Weakness
          <lb/>and Debility of the Stomach, is most conducive to Health,
          <lb/>when made with Endive-water. But since in Distillation what
          <lb/>riles in the Alembic from the Endive does not partake os its
          <lb/>Iaponaceous Qualities, .and since that Plant is found to contain
          <lb/>no aromatic and Volatile Parts, I see no Reason why Endivewater
          <lb/>should be more proper sor this Purpose than pure com- </p>
        <pb n="117"/>
        <p>mon Water, or distil'd Water. Corroborating and stomachic
          <lb/>Virtues are in vain sought for in Endive-water ; bur these may
          <lb/>much more probably be found in a little Wine added to the
          <lb/>Chocolate,, if no Circumstances concur to contraindicate such a
          <lb/>Practice. When Chocolate is prescribed as a Medidne, the
          <lb/>Physician must determine the Quantity, and six the proper Seasons
          <lb/>os Exhibition. Such aS are become weak; in Consequence
          <lb/>of Inanition, may judge of the Quantity from the Sense of Reh
          <lb/>freshment they seel; but at the same time they ought to use it
          <lb/>more sparingly than those who are vigorous and robust.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Having thus considered Chocolate as a Drink, we now home
          <lb/>to view it in another Light; that is, when used in preparing
          <lb/>Victuals. Many, then, add powder'd Chocolate to certain
          <lb/>Foods; as an Aromatic, for the sake of a inore grateful Smell;
          <lb/>and delicious Taste. They also mix it with Broths, and other
          <lb/>Dishes, But 'tis obvious, that the more of it is used for these
          <lb/>Purposes, the Food becomes not only inore fragrant to the
          <lb/>Small, and grateful to the Taste, but also more nutritive.
          <lb/>Others, especially on a Journey, in the Morning, eat Chocolate
          <lb/>dry, without any foreign Mixture; this supplies the Place
          <lb/>of an aromatic Confection, and defends them from the Injuries
          <lb/>of the cold and damp Air; fince, by stimulating the Juices into
          <lb/>4 somewhat brisker Motion, it in some measure prevents those
          <lb/>unlucky Consequences which are generally produced by an obstructed
          <lb/>Perspiration. Besides, as Travellers are sometimes
          <lb/>reduced toStmights for want of Fond, this Defect may,. in some
          <lb/>measure, be fupply'd by Chocolate; of which are also made
          <lb/>Sweetmeats, and other Delicacies, Very gratesol to the Taste,
          <lb/>whose Virtues may he judg'd of from what has already been
          <lb/>said of Chocolate, and a Consideration of the other Substances
          <lb/>winch enter their Compositions. The <hi>Royal Chocolate</hi>, for
          <lb/>Instance, prepar'd sor <hi>Uladisiaus</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
          <lb/>and preserved among the <hi>Arcana CAosseliana</hi>, is made thus:</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Take four Ounces of <hi>Indian</hi> Chocolate, reduc'd to a Powder,
          <lb/>and pass'd through a Sierce ; of powder'd <hi>Canary</hi> Sugar,
          <lb/>One Pound ; twelve sweet Almonds decorticated, and well
          <lb/>heat in a Marble Mortar: Let thefe be sufficiently mix'd,
          <lb/>incorporated with Whites of Eggs, and by a long Agitation
          <lb/>converted into Foam ; then add between half a Drain
          <lb/>and a Dram of Ambergrise, triturated with <hi>Canary</hi> Sugar ;
          <lb/>and of Mush dissolved in Sugar of Roses, half a Scruple.
          <lb/>Reduce the Whole into a Mass, of which form small
          <lb/>Cakes an Inch square, to be laid upon Paper, and dry'd
          <lb/>Over a small Iron Furnace.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Rob of Chocolate, prepared with Saffron and Oil of
          <lb/>Almonds, is by <hi>Bruckman</hi> recommended as a Specific in
          <lb/>Coughs. The <hi>Confectio Pacifica de Succolata Inda</hi>, in <hi>Myn sicht</hi>,
          <lb/>is an Electuary, which, besides Chocolate, consists of a
          <lb/>great Number of Aromatics, and other stimulating and nutritive
          <lb/>Ingredients. It is recommended as a Secret of wonderful
          <lb/>Efficacy in the Cure of Venereal Impotence, if, after proper
          <lb/>Evacuations, a Piece of the Bulk of a Chesiiut is daily used.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I must here also observe, that 'tis customary for some to mix
          <lb/>purgative, antifebrile, and other Medicines, with Chocolate,
          <lb/>in order to render them more grateful and agreeable to the Patient
          <lb/>; but whether, and in what Cases, it is a proper Vehicle
          <lb/>for other Medicines, must be judg'd from what has already heen
          <lb/>said concerning it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">From what has been advanc'd, we must he guided in our
          <lb/>Judgment, whether Chocolate is proper for all those to whose
          <lb/>Palates it is agreeable. When moderately used, it seems to contribute
          <lb/>to the Health of those who are in no Danger of having
          <lb/>their Juices stimulated into too brisk a Motion, or their Constitutions
          <lb/>overheated by the Use of Aromatics ; as also of those
          <lb/>whose Stomachs are able to concoct and subdue the pinguious
          <lb/>and tenacious Substance of the Cacao Nut. Hence 'tis obvious,
          <lb/>thet those People must abstain from the frequent and immoderate
          <lb/>Use of it, whe are in the full Vigour of- Youth; whose
          <lb/>Juices are easily put into preternatural Commotions ; who have
          <lb/>spare dry Constitutions ; and whose <hi>Prima Via</hi>, in consequence
          <lb/>of having lost their Tone, are unfit for a due Concoction
          <lb/>Of the Aliments. The Expressions then of <hi>Piperus, Corall. ad

          <lb/>the Apples of the Tree of Life, it preserves from Death, and
          <lb/>the Infirmities of <hi>Saps</hi>, are evidently hyperhelical and extravagant

          <lb/>concerning Chocolate, I shall, from <hi>Caldera</hi>, who

          <lb/>are produced by the Inflation and Distention ofthe Stomach occasioned

          <lb/>the Hypochondriac always abound, meeting with the earthy and
          <lb/>oleous Parts of the Chocolate, produces a tough. Viscid Mafs,
          <lb/>which, adhering strongly to the Foldings os the Stomach and Duodenum,
          <lb/>lays a Foundation for the above-mentioned Disorders,
          <lb/>in this Case I have observ'd, that a gentle Emetic has afforded

          <lb/>in Cases where the Tone of the Stomach is lost, and the Patient

        <p rend="indent">According to the different Colour, Bulk, Tenacity, Acrimony,

          <lb/>arise, which may he esteem'd Symptoms of a Cachexy.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thus the Skin appears white, pale, yellow, livid, red, green,
          <lb/>black, or tawny; the Patient perceives a Sensation os Gravity

          <lb/>Tumors of the Parts remote from the Heart ; Palpitations of
          <lb/>the Heart and Arteries, which are augmented by the least
          <lb/>Motion ; crude and thin Urine; spontaneous, and evidently

          <lb/><hi rend="sup">V</hi> nomy,. by which a Part of the Juices is applied to the Solids,
          <lb/>whenever the Force os the Circulation is either too languid,
          <lb/>or too violent. '</p>
        <p rend="indent">From whet has been said, a Cachexy may be <hi rend="u">easily</hi> distinguish'd.
          <lb/>And as to the Consequences thereof, they may he'
          <lb/>foreseen by carefully considering the Cause, Standing, Effects,

          <lb/>for it is evident, that a Mitigation, and moderate Inspiration,'
          <lb/>of the too acrid and too fluid Juices are sometimes requir'd ;
          <lb/>and, in other Cases, the tenacious and adhering Juices must he

          <lb/>Inspissation, of the Juices may be induc'd by various Causes,
          <lb/>it will be necessary to vary the Medicines, and the Manner of
          <lb/>applying them, as the different Causes shall determine.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Put the principal Rules to be observ'd in the Cure are.</p>
        <p rend="indent">First, To administer such Aliment as approaches nearly to
          <lb/>the Nature of the healthful Fluids of the Body, which are
          <lb/>easily digestible; which are in their Nature opposite to the
          <lb/>Cause, of the Disorder ; and which are agreeable to the Patient.
          <lb/>’ ' ' :</p>
        <p rend="indent">Secondly, To promote the Digestion of such Aliments, by
          <lb/>seasoning them with proper Aromatics; by drinking proper
          <lb/>Quantities of generous Wine; and by Exercise and Air.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thirdly, To dispose the Organs of Digestion to perform
          <lb/>their Duties, by proper gentle Digestives, Vomits, Purges,
          <lb/>-and Corroborants. '</p>
        <p rend="indent">Fourthly, As soon asthe Passages.are relax'd, and the morbid
          <lb/>Matter is attenuated, to promote its Expulsion, by attenuating
          <lb/>Diuretics and Sudorifics. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">Lastly, To complete the Cure by ChalybeateS, alcaline
          <lb/>rand saponaceous Substances, together with Walking, Riding, or
          <lb/>other proper Exercises, Frictions, and .Baths. i</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Cause however of the Distemper only can determine
          <lb/>the Choice of all these, and the Manner of applying them.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When a Cachectic Consumption arises from too great an
          <lb/>Acrimony of the Juices; the particular Species Of Acrimony
          <lb/>-must, if possible, be. discover’d.. .. χ</p>
        <p rend="indent">First, By investigating the Cause of the Cachexy.</p>
        <p rend="indent">r Secondly, By examining into the Nature of the Disease,
          <lb/>.and the Constitution of .the. Patient.........</p>
        <p rend="indent">Thirdly, By the Symptoms. . *.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Fourthly, By the Excretions. .</p>

          <lb/>any Aliment which is. superior to the Force Of the digestive
          <lb/>.Organs; and that moreover, he . uses little or no Exercise.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Upon this Occasion it is not likely; that .the Aliment should
          <lb/>. . be digested and assimilated, To as to produce good Blondbut
          <lb/>.in proportion, as the Aliment is more or less dissolv’d, the
          <lb/>; partially dissolv'd Portions will stagnate .in the first, ,or more
          <lb/>. remote Series of Veffeis, That .is, in the larger or smaller
          <lb/>: Veffeis;. and. will, cause various Disorders, according to the
          <lb/>. Uses and Importance'of the Farts which they obstruct.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Suppose the Aliment so little distblofd, that the largest Par..

        <p rend="indent">Mass <hi>os</hi> Blood, with which circulating till they arrive at the
          <lb/>-Lungs, they eitherpass not.at all, or with Difficulty, thro’
          <lb/>i : the minute.Vessels of that Organ,, on account of 'their Bulk :</p>
        <p rend="indent">Hence Difficulty of .Breathing, and Palpitations, arise. - And
          <lb/>-as.the Bloed should be farther elaborated, and receive its red</p>
        <p rend="indent">Colour in the Lungs, this Impediment will in some Degree

          <lb/>Animal Oeconomy. For this Reason the watery Particles
          <lb/>readily separate from the rest, and loiter, or stagnate in different
          <lb/>Parts, where they cause soft Tumors, as under the Eyes»
          <lb/>and in the Parts remote from the Heart. As these large Par- *
          <lb/>tides must, moreover, stagnate in the Glands, and obstruct them,
          <lb/>the Secretions of their respective Fluids must be impair’d.
          <lb/>For this Reason many of the aqueous Particles, which should
          <lb/>either he separated for Expulsion, or apply’d to particular
          <lb/>Uses, are retain'd in the Mass of Blood ; the Bile also, a
          <lb/>Fluid os the. utmost importance in Digestion, as well aS the
          <lb/>Pancreatic Juice, hecomes defective, inert, and languid ; and
          <lb/>all the Solids are farther relax'd, and, amongst them, the Orgaits
          <lb/>of Digestion; whence every subsequent Meal lays a new
          <lb/>Foundation sor an Increase os the Disorder, and all its Symptoms.
          <lb/>The Consequences of all this are, all the Symptoms

        <p rend="indent">1 must add. That when Women have acquir'd such a Habit,
          <lb/>the watery Particles of the Bloed loiter, or stagnate ; and the
          <lb/>other Particles are too large to pass thro' the minute Uterine

          <lb/>following manner;<space type="tab"> </space>;</p>
        <p rend="hanging">They take some Pieces of the best Copper and Calamine,,
          <lb/>first calcinId, and finely powder'd ; lay them in Strata in
          <lb/>large Pots, each os which holds about fifty Pounds, Some
          <lb/>add Glass likewise; and some use the <hi>Cadmia</hi> of the Furnaces,
          <lb/>instead of the fossil Kind. These Pots are set in
          <lb/>an arched Furnace, on Iron. Stands, placed in the Middle
          <lb/>of it, and the Fire iS kindled helow them. In the upper
          <lb/>Part of each Furnace is a round Hole, cover'd with a
          <lb/>Stone, hy which they regulate the Fire. When the Mixture
          <lb/>in the Pots has heen thus exposed to a Very great Degree
          <lb/>of Fire, and continued in Fusion, for eight or nine
          <lb/>Hours, it is changed to Brass, and increased very much in
          <lb/>specific Gravity, the' it has not yet the Gold-colour..
          <lb/>The Pots, heing cool’d, are taken out os the Furnace; and.
          <lb/>the Brass, which is now of the Colour of white Embers,
          <lb/>and cavernous like a Pumice-stone, is melted a second
          <lb/>time, and thrown into a Mould, the Sides of which are
          <lb/>Stone, and the Wideness or Distance between, these Sides
          <lb/>equal to the Thickness that the Brass-plates,, now become
          <lb/>os a yellow or gold Colour, are desired to he of. These
          <lb/>Plates are afterwards beat upon the Anvil, to make them
          <lb/>perfectly uniform.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The other Way of making Brass is to</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Take a Vestel in which Silver is usually melted, to coat it on
          <lb/>the Outside with Clay, mix'd with Filings of Iron ; and
          <lb/>to line the Inside with the purest Honey. Small Copperplates,
          <lb/>of about a Finger's Breadth, are likewise rubb'd
          <lb/>over with the same Honey, and then cover'd with fine
          <lb/>Powder of Calamine, crude Tartar, and Charcoal made of
          <lb/>the Lime-tree, min'd in equal Quantities. The Plates,
          <lb/>thus prepared, are thrown into the Vestel, and the Vestal
          <lb/>cover'd with a Brick, over which the Coat of Clay is like-.
          <lb/>wife Carried, a Hole being made, in the. Middle large</p>
        <p rend="indent">enough to admit an Iron Rod; to stir the melted Metal:
          <lb/>' The Vestel is then set in such a Furnace as the Refiners</p>
        <p rend="indent">use ; and, as soon as the C<hi rend="u">alam</hi>ine begins to mix with the
          <lb/>.) Copper, a red Smoak ascends, which afterwards becomes
          <lb/>. partly red, and partly blue, and last of all yellow ; and this
          <lb/>.. shews, that the Mixture is now perfected. The Vessel</p>
        <p rend="indent">heing then taken out of the Furnace, the Brass is found of
          <lb/>a perfect Gold-colour. In this Operation the Copper
          <lb/>takes up a third Part, or at least a fourth Part, of itsWeight

          <lb/>ὑστεροτημοτεκία, tho' these Words are not to be found in the
          <lb/>Writings of the <hi>Greek</hi> Physicians, in order to draw an <hi>Odiunt</hi>
          <lb/>upon this Practice, we are told, that some os the most expert
          <lb/>and knowing Physicians and Surgeons have not only censur'd the .
          <lb/>Operation as unsafe and cruel, but absolutely condemn'd it, as
          <lb/>necessarily and unavoidably productive of Death. The Authors
          <lb/>commonly alledg'd as favouring this Opinion, are <hi>Pare, Guise
          <lb/>lirneau, Palsincius, Hoorn, Mauriceau, Solingen</hi>, and some
          <lb/>others, who are asserted to he <hi>siworn Enemies to the Cas.arean
          <lb/>Section</hi>. But, upon a careful Perusal of the Works of thefe
          <lb/>Authors, I find none of them promiscuously condemning the
          <lb/>Operation in all Circumstances, hut only in certain dangerous
          <lb/>Coses; when, for Instance, <hi>the Foetus is io be cut from the
          <lb/>Uterus of the Mother, as yet alive</hi>; in which Case, and others
          <lb/>of a like dangerous Nature, the aboVe-mention'd Authors have
          <lb/>observ'd the most fatal Consequences resulting from the Operation.
          <lb/>But, for the sake of Accuracy, I must here observe, that
          <lb/>there are three Coses in which the <hi>Caesarean Section</hi> is necessary.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The first is, when a pregnant Woman dies, either hefore
          <lb/>the stated Time of Delivery, especially in the last Months,
          <lb/>when the Foetus is perfect, and suppos'd alive; or when she dies
          <lb/>in Labour; or is cut off by a Violent Death, and the Foetus is
          <lb/>perceiv'd alive in the Uterus, or at least is, upon good Grounds,
          <lb/>presum’d to be so.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The second Case is, when the Mother is still alive, and the
          <lb/>Foetus dead, but, at the same time, so unnaturally situated, as
          <lb/>that it cannot come into the World in the natural Way, either
          <lb/>by the Efforts of the Mother, or the Art and Skill of the Midwise
          <lb/>or Physician, in winch Case the Life of the Mother is in
          <lb/>the highest and most evident Danger.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The third Case is, when both the Mother and Foetus are still
          <lb/>alive; but the Foetus, as in the former Cafe, can neither he
          <lb/>expel'd in the natural Way, by the Efforts of the Mother, *
          <lb/>nor extracted by the Art of the Midwife, so that both the Mo* </p>
        <pb n="125"/>
        <p rend="indent">ther and the Foetus must he in the most imminent and unavoidable
          <lb/>Danger os Death, unless they are sav'd by the <hi>Cafarean
          <lb/>Section</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the first Cafe, that is, when the Mother is dead, and the
          <lb/>Foetus reasonably presum'd to be alive, I find few or none of
          <lb/>the more noted Physicians and Surgeons, who disapprove of
          <lb/>the Operation, since, without it, the Foetus must necessarily
          <lb/>die, aS well as the Mother. And, as Delays in this Cose are
          <lb/>highly dangerous, they universally agree, not only that the deceas'd
          <lb/>Mother should be laid open, but also that the Operation
          <lb/>should be perform'd aS soon aS is possible; because, generally
          <lb/>. speaking, the FcetuS does not long survive the Death of the
          <lb/>Mother; tho' <hi>Dolnes, in Encyclopced. Lib</hi>. 4. <hi>Cap</hi>. 5. informs
          <lb/>us, that he perceiv'd the Foetus to move in the Belly the Day
          <lb/>aster the Death os the Mother. In consequence os the Operation
          <lb/>being perform'd in this Case, we have several Instances, not
          <lb/>only in the remoter, but also in the latter Ages, of the Foetus
          <lb/>being taken alive from the Belly <hi>os</hi> the Mother. Accordingly,
          <lb/>among the Antients, this memorable Circumstance is recorded
          <lb/>Or <hi>Lycas</hi>, mentiossd by <hi>Virgil</hi>, of <hi>Alseulapius</hi>, os <hi>Scipio Asm.,
          <lb/>canus</hi>, thence denominated <hi>Cafar</hi>, of <hi>Manlius</hi>, and, according
          <lb/>to some, of the Emperor <hi>Julius Cafar</hi> ; and, in latter Ages, of
          <lb/><hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, King of <hi>England</hi>, of <hi>Sanctius</hi>, King of
          <lb/><hi>Navarre</hi>, arid several others mention'd by different Authors,
          <lb/>and from that Circumstance call'd <hi>Ccesures</hi> or <hi>Ccnsones</hi>. When,
          <lb/>therefore, the Mother is already dead, or when the Surgeon
          <lb/>perceives her to be struggling with the Agonies of Death, he
          <lb/>should take cure to have every thing prepar'd sor the Operation,
          <lb/>that, when she is actually dead, he may be ready to save the
          <lb/>Foetus, either by making a crucial Incision in the ..Abdomen,
          <lb/>as in ordinary Dissections ; or, which is a safer and more cautious
          <lb/>Method, by a large longitudinal Incision, and not a crucial
          <lb/>one, as most advise, made on either Side, with a Razor or
          <lb/>Incision-knife, without, any Regard to the Direction os the
          <lb/>muscular Fibres, or the Course os the Blood-Veffels. The
          <lb/>Operation may be perform'd either in the Bed, or upon a convenient
          <lb/>Table. Is the Foetus has fallen into the Cavity os the
          <lb/>Abdomen, either in consequence os a Rupture in the Uterus,
          <lb/>or by some other Cause, it must, in this Case, he taken out as
          <lb/>soon as possible ; and fince, on the like Occasions, the Foetus is
          <lb/>generally Very weak, a littie <hi>Hungary</hi> Water, or some other
          <lb/>Liquor of a like Nature, may be held to its Nose, for the fake
          <lb/>of the Steam. The Breath also, either simply, or after having
          <lb/>drank a little Wine or Brandy, is to he blown into its Mouth
          <lb/>and Nostriis, in order to chear it. The Navel-string must be
          <lb/>. ty'd in the ordinary Manner, and, for Decency's fake. Baptism
          <lb/>administer'd. But if the Foetus remains conceal'd in the
          <lb/>Uterus, that Body must be cautioufly laid open, the Child extracted,
          <lb/>the Navel-string cut, and, if it is still alive, proper
          <lb/>Methods must be us'd to cherish and support it; and thus the
          <lb/>.Operation is at an End. If the Foetus is lodg'd in the Fallopian
          <lb/>Tube, or the Ovary, which sometimes happens, the Abdomen
          <lb/>is first to be laid open, and the Child carefully extracted ; pro-
          <lb/>c ceding in other respects aS before directed. But, in an Affair
          <lb/>of such Vast Importance as the <hi>Cafarean Section</hi>, the Surgeon
          <lb/>should carefully observe whether the Mother be really dead, or
          <lb/>only in a Deliquium, lest he rashly perform the Operation on a
          <lb/>live Woman, as we are told <hi>Visialius</hi> did. He should rather be
          <lb/>thoroughly satissy'd of the Mother's Death, by observing
          <lb/>whether there be any Motion of the Parts lest, especially os the
          <lb/>Heart, Arteries, and Lungs ; and have the joint Concurrence,
          <lb/>if possible, of the By-standers, aS to the Propriety of the Operation,
          <lb/>before he attempts the least Incision; tho', at the same
          <lb/>time, we have no Instances of the Mother reviving under the
          <lb/>Operation, aster she has been taken sor dead ; and tho' such an
          <lb/>Accident should really happen, the Surgeon has no Reason to
          <lb/>think, that he commits Murder, since, in consequence os his believing
          <lb/>the Mother to be dead, his Attempts to save the Foetus
          <lb/>not only flow from a Principle of Humanity, but are also authoriz'd
          <lb/>by the Laws os the Land. In such a deplorable Case, as
          <lb/>there are still some saint Remains os Hope, especially is the
          <lb/>' -Operation has been perform'd by a simple longitudinal Incssion
          <lb/>on one Side, the Surgeon must Hitch up the Wounds, and treat
          <lb/>them in the most skilful Manner he possibly can, since live Persons,
          <lb/>who have voluntarily submitted to have the Foetus extracted
          <lb/>in this Manner, have sometimes happily recover'd ; sor,
          <lb/>if the Surgeon should delay too long, from a mistaken Terror
          <lb/><hi>of</hi> murdering the Mother, the Foetus may be lost, and the
          <lb/>Operation perform'd In Vain. Some condemn the Operation
          <lb/>altogether, hecause, say they, aster the Death of the Mother,
          <lb/>we are not certain whether the Child is still alive; sor which
          <lb/>Reason they are not, in the Phrase of the Vulgar, for disturbing the
          <lb/>poor Mother, aster she is dead. The' I do not deny, that it
          <lb/>is often a hard Tash to determine certainly whether the Foetus
          <lb/>he dead or alive, and that, in consequence os this, the Operation
          <lb/>must often he perform’d in vain ; yet, in my Opinion, it
          <lb/>is still more adviseable to open ten, or even an hundred dead
          <lb/>- Mothers in Vain, than to lose one five Foetus for want of the
          <lb/>- Operation.</p>
        <p rend="indent">My Advice, in general, is, that the Operation should he</p>
        <p>Perform’d as foon as possible on all Women, who die either a
          <lb/>littie before,, or in the Very Pangs Of Delivery; partly that the
          <lb/>Foetus may he extracted alive, baptiz'd, and rescu'd from the
          <lb/>Jaws of Death; and partly for the better Information of Physicians,
          <lb/>Surgeons, and Midwives, to acquaint them with the
          <lb/>Figure, Bulk, and Structure of the Uterus in pregnantWomen,
          <lb/>with the Posture of the Foetus in it, the State of the Membranes,
          <lb/>the Disposition os the Secundines, and their Connexion
          <lb/>with the Uterus, that they may, at other times, be the hetter
          <lb/>qualify'd for affording Relief in Circumstances of a like Nature;
          <lb/>and partly, according to <hi>Deventer</hi>, that it may be discover'd
          <lb/>whether the Death of the Mother was owing to the Unskilfulness
          <lb/>of the Midwife or Surgeon, or to some other Cause ; that
          <lb/>they may be punish'd or acquitted accordingly, and arrive at a
          <lb/>greater Knowledge in their Profession. We must not then delay
          <lb/>performing the Operation upon a Woman who dies in these
          <lb/>Circumstances, much less must we bury her with the Foetus in
          <lb/>her Belly, which is too often the Case; since, on some Occafions,
          <lb/>the Child may remain alive in the Uterus a long time aster
          <lb/>the Death of the Mother ; sor I think it barbarous and inhuman,
          <lb/>repugnant to Christianity, and inconsistent with Mercy, to
          <lb/>bury the Child, as yet alive in the Uterus, with its dead Mother.
          <lb/>I therefore think, that not only among Christians, but
          <lb/>also where-ever Humanity and Compassion have the least Regard
          <lb/>paid them. Princes and Rulers should enact the severest Laws,
          <lb/>injoining that all Women, who have died during Pregnancy,
          <lb/>should not only be laid open hesore they are bury'd, but also
          <lb/>that this should be done immediately after the Death of the
          <lb/>Mother, by skilful Physicians and Surgeons, lest, by a Delay,
          <lb/>the Foetus should be allow'd to die in the Uterus, or, by omitting
          <lb/>the Operation altogether, it should he bury'd alive with its
          <lb/>dead Mother ; fince, in this Case, they might justly he said to he
          <lb/>murder'd, according to that eternal, immutable, and unalterable
          <lb/>Law of Nature, <hi>llrhom thou didst not fave from Death,
          <lb/>when it was in thy Power so to da, him thou hast bilfid</hi>. The most
          <lb/>antient of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings, tho' .destitute of the Light of ReVest'd
          <lb/>Religion, were mov'd with the highest Compassion for
          <lb/>Insanis in this Condition, fince they made a Law in their Favour
          <lb/>call'd the <hi>Lex regia</hi>, which may be justly dignify'd with the
          <lb/>Epithets <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi>, injoining. <hi>That no Woman who
          <lb/>died pregnant, soould be burfd before the Foetus was extracted
          <lb/>from her, and making it a capital Crime to do otherwise</hi>; adding
          <lb/>this aS a Reason, <hi>That he seems, by fo doing, to have destroy’dethe
          <lb/>Life of the Pentus</hi>. Their Intention in this Law, doubtless,
          <lb/>was, that the Operation should be perform'd in due Season,
          <lb/>that is, soon after the Death of the Mother; because the Foetus,
          <lb/>aS we know by Experience, does not long survive. But, tho'
          <lb/>most of our lawyers acknowledge the Equity and Sanctity of
          <lb/>tins Law, yet, by some unhappy Fate, it is seldom or never
          <lb/>minded any-where among Christians in our Times, but as
          <lb/>much neglected, as if there were nothing relating to it inserted
          <lb/>in the Body of the Law. <hi>Hildanus</hi>, indeed, telis us, that this
          <lb/>Royal Law was, <hi>for</hi> the most part, observ'd in his Country,
          <lb/>that is, in <hi>Stuitzcrland</hi>; but in other Countries, as far as I
          <lb/>could leans, they make no Scruple to bury their dead pregnant
          <lb/>Women without Section. Princes and Magistrates, indeed.
          <lb/>Convict and punish Wheres, when their Infants perish for want
          <lb/>of a Ligature os the Navel-string, or for some other Neglect;
          <lb/>and, in my Opinion, justly ; for which Reason I cannot but
          <lb/>the more wonder, thet they inflict no Punishment on those by
          <lb/>whose Fault, or Negligence, the Children of those who die
          <lb/>pregnant, perish in the Womb, when they might often have
          <lb/>heen preserv'd ; since the Life os a Child is aS much concern'd
          <lb/>in one Case as the other, and the Guilt in both Cases is alike.
          <lb/>Pertinent to this Purpose is whet <hi>Mauriceau, Observ</hi>. 345. relates

          <lb/>who dy'd without Delivery, to he rip’d open, and so wilfully
          <lb/>occasion'd the Death of the Child ; a Crime which deserves to
          <lb/>be severely punish'd: So here, at <hi>Helmstadt</hi>, a Man would not
          <lb/>suffer me to make an incision in his dead Sister, but threaten'd
          <lb/>to shoot me, if I came into his Doors upon such an Account <hi>r</hi>
          <lb/>and so the Child also perish'd. I cannot but think, that Legislators
          <lb/>would do nothing improper, or unbecoming their Office, by
          <lb/>taking all due Care, and issuing strict Orders, that no pregnant
          <lb/>Woman, who dies hesore or in the Time of Travel, should be
          <lb/>interred before Incision of her Belly and Uterus.</p>

          <lb/>the Mother from the Foetus, and from imminent Death ; and
          <lb/>we are not without Examples, in Various Authors, of this
          <lb/>Section heing happily perform'd ; so that <hi>Mauriceau</hi> speaks
          <lb/>against Reason and Experience, when he asserts, that this
          <lb/>Section is always mortal to the Mother; sor which Reason he
          <lb/>is also reprehended by <hi>La Motte</hi>, who was himself no Friend to
          <lb/>this Operation, but rejected it on some Very proper Occasions.</p>
        <p rend="indent">However, tho' there be many Examples of this Operation
          <lb/>heing perform'd successfully, and tho' there are Very sew but
          <lb/>will admit of a Section of the Belly and Uterus, when the
          <lb/>Mother is dead, and even while she is alive, if Nature points
          <lb/>out the Way, by some Tumor, Pain, or Abscess, in some
          <lb/>Part of the Belly, as on one Side, or aheut the Navel, in
          <lb/>which Case this Operation is usually perform'd with Success, as
          <lb/>several Authors have observ'd, because it is follow'd by little or
          <lb/>no Haemorrhage, and the Foetus, on these Occasions, generally
          <lb/>-sticks in the Fallopian Tube, the Ovary, or the Cavity Of the
          <lb/>Abdomen; yet there are some Very eminent Physicians and
          <lb/>Surgeons, who will by no means admit of it, and not only
          <lb/>dissuade from the Practice os it, but utterly condemn it, as cruel
          <lb/>and barbarous, and always destructive and fatal to the Mother,
          <lb/>when the Foetus is detain'd in the Uterus, and no Abscess
          <lb/>manifests itself. Some of the principal Gentiemen os this Opinion
          <lb/>are <hi>Guillemeau, Mauriceau, Rolsincius</hi>, and <hi>Solingen;</hi>
          <lb/>and for this Reason, hecause they always observ'd it to be sue'
          <lb/>ceeded by the Death os the Mother ; tho' that might often happen
          <lb/>from some other Cause. And some <hi>of</hi> them do not stick
          <lb/>at branding those Physicians, who advise or undertake this Operation
          <lb/>while the Foetus is in the Uterus, and no Abscess is difcover'd,
          <lb/>with the Titles os <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>rasui</hi>, because, say they,
          <lb/>the Foetus should rather be extracted, by the natural Passage,
          <lb/>with the Hand, or by the Help of Instruments, and not by
          <lb/>ripping up the Belly and Uterus, with the utmost Danger of the
          <lb/>Mother's Lise, by the <hi>Ceefarean Section</hi>. But these Gentiemen
          <lb/>are sufficiently confuted, heth by Reason, and the Experience of
          <lb/>Tome of the most sagacious and approv'd Physicians and Surgeons,
          <lb/>fuch as <hi>Pesset, Bauhine, Sennertus, Hildanus, Fienus, Scultetus,
          <lb/>Scipio Mercurius, Roonhuysen, Ruleau, Lancisi, Sa.
          <lb/>viand, fobert, La Motte, Toichmeierus</hi>, and others, who all
          <lb/>assure us, that the Mother has sometimes happily surviv'd the
          <lb/>Operation.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I confess, with respect to the Mother, the Operation is Very
          <lb/>. dubious and hazardous, especially when the Foetus is to be cut
          <lb/>out of the Uterus, and no Abscess appears ; and, therefore, I
          <lb/>am of Opinion, that it ought not to be undertaken without
          <lb/>absolute Necessity; tho', from what has been said, and whet
          <lb/>will further he remark'd, I cannot but think it, on some Occasions,
          <lb/>useful and necessary. <hi>Gouey</hi>, indeed, one Of the latest
          <lb/>Writers of Surgery among the <hi>French, Resset, Scipio Mcrcurius,</hi>
          <lb/>and <hi>iVielfchius</hi>, endeavour to prove, that the <hi>Ceefarean Section</hi>
          <lb/>has no more of Difficulty or Danger in it, than cutting for the
          <lb/>Stone; and, <hi>if</hi> dexteroufly manag'd, ought to be frequently
          <lb/>. undertaken, as appears from Examples winch they bring. But,
          <lb/>for my part, I cannot consent to so great a Length, and that
          <lb/>for weighty Reasons, added to the Observations of <hi>Pare, Guillemeau,
          <lb/>Rolsincius, Mauriceau</hi>, and <hi>Solingen</hi>, shewing the frequent
          <lb/>unhappy Events winch attend such an Operation ; and,
          <lb/>particularly, because of the Danger of an immoderate Haemorrhage,
          <lb/>or a Gangrene, and the Hazard which accompanies
          <lb/>Wounds of the Uterus, especially in pregnant Women, as was
          <lb/>long ago well observ’d hy <hi>Celsus, Lib</hi>. 5. <hi>Cap</hi>. 56. <hi>Mauriceau,</hi>
          <lb/>with some others, as I observ'd, is sor extracting the dead Foetus
          <lb/>always by the natural Passages, with the Hands, or by the Help
          <lb/>of Instruments, rather than have recourse to so dangerous an
          <lb/>Operation as the <hi>Ceefarean Section</hi>. I heartily agree with this
          <lb/>their Opinion, as often as the thing is practicable ; and utterly
          <lb/>disapprove the Rashness of those Surgeons, who have Ventur'd
          <lb/>upon a Section of the Belly, when the Foetus mtght have been
          <lb/>extracted by the Vagina, tho' the Operation was sometimes attended
          <lb/>with Success. However, since Cases often occur, such
          <lb/>as I mention'd above, where it.,is impossible to extract the
          <lb/>Foetus by the usual Passage, and the Mother is in utmost Danger
          <lb/>of perishing, on account of its Detension in the Uterus, I
          <lb/>look upon it as a barbarous and impious thing to leave the unhappy
          <lb/>Woman, who earnestly implores our Assistance, or at least
          <lb/>extremely wants it, without Help ; and am of Opinion, that, in
          <lb/>Cases os Extremity, the last or most desperate Remedies are te</p>
        <p>he us'd ; and Certainly, according to the Judgments of <hi>Hipfri.
          <lb/>crates</hi> and <hi>Celsius</hi>, the Venerable Fathers of Medicine, a dubious
          <lb/>Remedy is better than none, and preferable, in such Cases, to
          <lb/>leaving the poor Woman helpless in that most deplorable State,
          <lb/>under the greatest Torments, and giving her up to inevitable
          <lb/>Death, while there is still Hope of saving her, aS appears from
          <lb/>happy Examples. Therefore I think thoso Physicians much in
          <lb/>the wrong, who had .the Care of the Woman mention'd by
          <lb/><hi>Saviard, Obferv</hi>. I I4. who, when they found the Birth was
          <lb/>impossible, hecause of the Narrowness os the Passages, would
          <lb/>not undertake a Section, but left heth Child and Mother to
          <lb/>perish together. And in his <hi>Obferv</hi>. 6o. we have an Instance
          <lb/>of a Woman who beg'd for Section, but could not obtain iti
          <lb/>Some there are, as <hi>Mauriceau, Lamotte</hi>, and others, who
          <lb/>acknowledge, that there are Cases in which it is impossible for
          <lb/>the Foetus to be brought away by the ordinary Passage, and yet
          <lb/>advise, in such a Circumstance, to leave the Conduct of the
          <lb/>Matter wholly to Nature, rather than expose the Patients to so
          <lb/>dangerous a Section; because Nature often finds out Ways, by
          <lb/>means of an Abscess in the Belly, Navel, Groin, or <hi>Intestinum
          <lb/>Rectum</hi>, to expel the putresy'd Foetus with less Danger than it
          <lb/>could he extracted by Section of the Belly. In this I agree
          <lb/>with them, as often and as long aS the Mother is in no Danger .
          <lb/>of her Lise from this Forheasance, which is sometimes the
          <lb/>Case: But when the Danger is urgent, when by too long
          <lb/>waiting we hurt, and in a manner kill the Mother, I think we
          <lb/>ought to have recourse to the last Remedies, especially such as
          <lb/>have been known to succeed, rather than give up the Patient,
          <lb/>who might be under a Possibility of being helped, tho' by a dubious
          <lb/>Remedy, to an unavoidable and most miserable Death.
          <lb/>For, certainly, a Physician seems to me then only to have discharg'd
          <lb/>his Duty to the full, and satissy'd his Conscience, when
          <lb/>he has done all things, and omitted nothing that he knows to he
          <lb/>serviceable, and which he is sensible has done Good in other
          <lb/>Cases of the like kind, without regarding whet some, perhaps,
          <lb/>may object against his Proceedings,-especially when the Patient
          <lb/>herself, whose Life is dear to her, and who had rather try a dubious
          <lb/>Remedy than none at all, defines it of him. Others there
          <lb/>are, who confess that the Reason why they will not undertake
          <lb/>this Operation, is the Disgrace they are like to undergo, if it
          <lb/>should not succeed : But this seems to me a Very Vain and trifling
          <lb/>Excuse in so serious an Affair, and hardly becoming a good
          <lb/>Man, much less a Christian Physician, who, in the way of his
          <lb/>Duty, ought to stand in Awe of no Man, much less to he deterred
          <lb/>by the Censures of the Vulgar, or the Calumnies of the
          <lb/>Malicious. Tn short, all things are to be done by a Physician
          <lb/>for the Preservation of his Patients in general, and especially
          <lb/>those 'of the weaker and tender Sex, in this their most miserable
          <lb/>and helpless Condition. And <hi>Lamotte</hi> himself has several
          <lb/>times perform'd Operations on Women, and particularly the
          <lb/>Extraction os the Foetus, eVen against the Mother's Consent ;
          <lb/>to accomplish which, he order'd Women in such a Circumstance
          <lb/>to be held by strong Men, that he might by Force extract the
          <lb/>Child, when in an ill Situation, in what manner he thought sit;
          <lb/>Now, if he thinks such a Proceeding to he fair and lawful, why
          <lb/>may we nos, with a safe Conscience, use the same Violent Means
          <lb/>for extracting the Child by a Section of the Belly, that, if the
          <lb/>Mother will not Voluntarily submit to what ikilFuI Physicians
          <lb/>shall judge necessary for her Preservation, she may he compel'd
          <lb/>by Force to undergo it ? For my part, I see no Reason to the
          <lb/>contrary. How much more then are we to lend our Assistance
          <lb/>in the former Cafe, when it is not only Voluntarily desir'd, but
          <lb/>earnestly intreated l</p>
        <p rend="indent">If, then, the unhappy Woman consent to submit to Section,
          <lb/>or Voluntarily desire it, the first thing to be consider'd is, whether
          <lb/>she has sufficient Strength to undergo the Operation. For is she
          <lb/>he Very weak and low, be hold in the extreme Parts, and in a
          <lb/>cold Sweat, it is to he fear'd, that she will die soon after the
          <lb/>Section, and so the Couse of her Death, by ignorant and malicious
          <lb/>Persons, may be imputed to the Operation, and the Sutgeon.
          <lb/>It is best, therefore, in this Circumstance, to forbear
          <lb/>such an Undertaking, lest, as <hi>Celsius</hi> says. <hi>Lib. 5. Cap</hi>. I 6. we
          <lb/>might be thought to kill the Woman, who, in reality, dies of.
          <lb/>the Violence of her Distemper. But if she be.in good Strength
          <lb/>and Heart, and there is Hope of saving the Mother, or Child,
          <lb/>or heth," the Operation is to he readily undertaken; for the
          <lb/>right Performance of which, we are to consider, first, what
          <lb/>is to he done before the Operation; secondly, whet is to he
          <lb/>done under the Performance; and, thirdly, whet aster it. Before
          <lb/>the Operation the proper Instruments are to be laid ready,
          <lb/>which are, a strait Knife, firmly set in the Handle, and such as
          <lb/>is represented <hi>{Tab</hi>. 32. <hi>Fig</hi>. 8.) ; or such a one as is commonly
          <lb/>used in anatomical Dissections, or else a Razor, or some such
          <lb/>Instrument; or one of the blunt instruments, represented <hi>{scabs</hi>26.)
          <lb/>; also a blunt-pointed Pain of Scissius, with crooked
          <lb/>Needles, threaded with strong Threads, or Cords, aS for Gastroraphy
          <lb/>; a clean Sponge or two ; hot Wine, or some hot Vulnerary
          <lb/>Decoction in a Vessel; with the proper Apparatus os
          <lb/>Bandage, consisting of Lint; Plaisters, . Polsters, and Fillet?;
          <lb/>not forgetting internal corroborative Medicines, and external </p>
        <pb n="127"/>
        <p>ones, to he apply'd, if needful, to the Month and Nostrils.
          <lb/>All these Things heing fitiy disposed out of the Woman's Sight,
          <lb/>she is first to make Water, lest the Bladder, heing distended
          <lb/>with Urine, might he exposed to the Knife ; she is then to he
          <lb/>placed in a proper Situation, either on a Table, or Bed, in the
          <lb/>midst of the Chamher, on her Back, in fuch a manner as that
          <lb/>the Attendants may have convenient Access; and her Spirits are
          <lb/>to be kept up by pleasing and pious Words, her Face being
          <lb/>cover’d, that she may not be terrify’d at the Sight of the Instruments
          <lb/>; and her Arms and Legs are to he held by at least four
          <lb/>robust Persons, that she may lie immoveable ; or, if you think
          <lb/>fit, they may be ty'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Surgeon then, standing at that Side of the Woman which
          <lb/>seems most convenient, enters a strait Knife by the external
          <lb/>Side of the Musculus Rectus, or in the Space between the Navel
          <lb/>and the upper and fore Eminence of the Os Ileum, where
          <lb/>Persons are now usually tap'd for the Dropsy, (winch seems to
          <lb/>me, as yes, the fittest Place) making a strait Incision, first thro'
          <lb/>the Skin and Fat, about eight or ten Fingers-breadth in Length,
          <lb/>after thet, thro' the <hi>Musculi Obliqui</hi> and <hi>Musculus Tranfuersus,</hi>
          <lb/>and, lastly, with the utmost Caution, thro' the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi>; where
          <lb/>the principal thing to be observ'd by the Surgeon is, to make but
          <lb/>a Very small Wound, or Aperture, with this first Knife, forfear of
          <lb/>hurting something withinside. Then with another Knife,
          <lb/>probe-pointed, <hi>{silab</hi>. 26.) or with the Sciffars, he is to dilate
          <lb/>the Wound; or, if he has not the last Instruments in Readiness,
          <lb/>or thinks sit to use but a sew, he may introduce his Finger
          <lb/>thro' the Wound into the Belly, and by the Assistance and Direction
          <lb/>hereof, with the first Knife, or with the Sciffars, inlarge
          <lb/>the Wound, till it seems wide enough sor the Extraction
          <lb/>of the Foetus, taking all possible Care, that he hurts nothing else
          <lb/>withinside, which may be readily avoided, by dexteroufly followIng
          <lb/>these Directions : A sufficient Aperture being made in the
          <lb/>Belly, the Situation of the Child, and where it sticks, is to be
          <lb/>thoroughly inspected. If it be found to lie without the Uterus
          <lb/>in the Cavity of the Abdomen, as it sometimes happens, you
          <lb/>are immediately to extract it, together with the Secundines. If
          <lb/>It be situated in the Fallopian Tube, or in the Ovary, an Incision
          <lb/>is to be cautiousty made in these Parts, and the Foetus,
          <lb/>with the Placenta, to be extracted thence. If the Foetus be
          <lb/>detain'd in the Womb, the Cose is more hazardous, for fear of
          <lb/>an immoderate Haemorrhage, or dangeroufly hurting the Uterus,
          <lb/>the Wounds of which Part have, from all Antiquity, been
          <lb/>observ'd to be Very pernicious, especially in pregnant Women.
          <lb/>However, fince the Child cannot be otherwise extracted, an inCision
          <lb/>is here also to he made, and afterwards in the Membranes
          <lb/>Of the Foetus, wide enough for accomplishing the Extraction.
          <lb/>This done, and the Foetus and Secundines being brought away,
          <lb/>the extravafated Blood in the Belly is to be deterg'd with Sponges
          <lb/>‘ expressed out of warm Wine, or some warm vulnerary Decoction
          <lb/>; and if the Effusion of Blood be immoderate, it should
          <lb/>he restrain'd by Lint moisten'd with highly rectisy'd Spirit of
          <lb/>Wine, and introduc'd into theWound of the Uterus; and the
          <lb/>divided Orifices of the larger uterine Veffeis are to be compressed
          <lb/>with the Fingers upon Lint, till the Haemorrhage ceases, or, at
          <lb/>least, is Very much abated. We have here Occasion to take
          <lb/>Notice, that Women, in Child-birth, and after it, often lose
          <lb/>a Vast Quantity os Blood without Danger of Death ; and,
          <lb/>therefore, the Surgeon ought not, on a sudden, to be terrify'd
          <lb/>at a pretty copious Haemorrhage on this Occasion, especially if
          <lb/>his Patient continues to preserve her Strength and Spirits. After
          <lb/>some reasonable Space of Time allow'd sor the Woman to recollect
          <lb/>her Spirits, and to he refresh'd with some corroborative
          <lb/>Medicine, the Lint is to he gently remov'd from the Wound,
          <lb/>and the Belly again deterg'd with warm Sponges. The Wounds
          <lb/>os the internal Parts are not to be sew'd, as some heretofore
          <lb/>directed ; but, aster an Application of Balsam of Capivi, or
          <lb/>Tomething like it, are to be left to Nature ; for, as the Uterus
          <lb/>gradually contracts itseif, the Lips oftheWound come together,'
          <lb/>and, at last, if nothing intervene to prevent the Cure, are
          <lb/>Conglutinated.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But the Wound in the Belly is to be sew'd up with two or
          <lb/>three Sutures, in the same manner as has been directed for
          <lb/>Wounds of the Abdomen (See ABD0MEN) ; and a Tent,
          <lb/>Pipe, or Canula, of considerable Bigness, is to be adapted to
          <lb/>the lower Part of the Wound, in order to keep it open ; sor
          <lb/>thro' this Aperture not only the noxious Humours, diseharg’d
          <lb/>from the Wound in the Uterus, and remaining within, and
          <lb/>thofe which continue to discharge themselves, may find a Vent,
          <lb/>but by the Help of Injections, as is practis'd in other Wounds of
          <lb/>the Breast and Abdomen, they may also be brought away. And
          <lb/>this Method must he continu'd till the Lips os the Wound are
          <lb/>conglutinated, and all Efflux of Pus, or any other Humour from
          <lb/>the external Wound, ceases; an indication that the internal
          <lb/>Wound is heal'd. Aster the Threads us'd in the Suture are cut and
          <lb/>extracted, omitting theTent or the Pipe, the exteriorWound
          <lb/>is also gradually conglutinated by Vulnerary Balsams, and agglutinating
          <lb/>Plaisters. Most, indeed, advise sewing the Wound of the
          <lb/>Belly; but, after considering the Matter with inyself, and observing
          <lb/>that other strait, or, aS they are Commonly call'd, longitudinal</p>
        <p>Wounds of the Abdomen, for the most part, need no Suture,
          <lb/>and, by the more modern Surgeons, are excepted from those which
          <lb/>are to he sew'd, fince their Lips may, for the most part, be
          <lb/>commodioufly join'd, and retain'd in Contact, by proper
          <lb/>Plaisters, and a large uniting Bandage, I am of Opinion, that,
          <lb/>in these Cases, we do not often stand in need of Suture, if
          <lb/>proper Bandage is carefully apply'd. <hi>Rjoufsis</hi>, taught by Experience,
          <lb/>declares that, in this Case, he did not think Suture
          <lb/>Very necessary: But, if Bandage should he thought absolutely
          <lb/>insufficient for the Purpose, then Suture is to be us'd. Some,
          <lb/>hefore the Section is made, mark with Ink not only the Part
          <lb/>where it should be made, but also where, and in what Places,
          <lb/>Suture should he perform'd ; but, as these Marks are quickly
          <lb/>Obliterated, and effac'd by the Effusion of Blond, I think this
          <lb/>Advice altogether trifling and useless. As sor the Situation of
          <lb/>the Patient in Bed after the Operation, most Authors advise,
          <lb/>that she should he continually on her Back ; but, to me, it
          <lb/>appears more proper, especially if the Wound has been made
          <lb/>on the Side, that the Patient should, as much as possible, lie
          <lb/>with the Wound undermost, that some Part of the noxious
          <lb/>Humours collected within may not only flow continually, and,
          <lb/>as it were, insensibly ouse from the external Wound, but also
          <lb/>that the Lips oftheWound may be the more easily agglutinated ;
          <lb/>which Advantage is more easily procur'd when the Section is
          <lb/>made in the Side, than when the Operation is perform’d in
          <lb/>the middle or anterior Part of the Belly. <hi>Roufsiet</hi> also advises,
          <lb/>that a hollow Pessary should be introduc'd into the Uterus, that
          <lb/>the Blood may he the more easily convey'd from- it. Besides,
          <lb/>the Physician must prescribe a proper Regimen, and suitable internal
          <lb/>Medicines, such as are, on other Occasions, order'd for
          <lb/>those who heve receiv'd large Wounds; and these are to be
          <lb/>persisted in, till the Patient is thoroughly recover'd, which, in
          <lb/><hi>Lancisus</hi> Patient, happen'd infix Weeks. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">From whet has been said, 'tis obvious to every one, that .
          <lb/>this Operation, especially when a Very large Aperture is made
          <lb/>in the Uterus, must be attended with the greatest Danger.
          <lb/>But fince there are many Instances of Mothers being preserv'd
          <lb/>hy this Operation, who must have otherwise died Very soon
          <lb/>according to all Appearance, and fince there is often no better,
          <lb/>and indeed no other. Method of relieving the miserable Woman,
          <lb/>I think itadviseable, rather to attempt this hazardous
          <lb/>Operation in Cases where all other Hopes of Relief are cut
          <lb/>Off, than to abandon the miserable Patient, and leave those to
          <lb/>the gloomy Prospect of unavoidable Death, who are often so
          <lb/>fond Os Life, as to submit to the most cruel Measures for preserving
          <lb/>it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Enough I think has already heen said concerning the common
          <lb/>and ordinary. Method os extracting the Foetus from the
          <lb/>Uterus. But as certain Coses now-and-then occur, in winch,
          <lb/>the Operation is to be otherwise perform'd, these also deserve
          <lb/>our Consideration. When, sor Instance, the Foetus can neither
          <lb/>be hern in the natural manner, nor extracted from the
          <lb/>Uterus, there appears any Tumor or Abscess in some Part of ,
          <lb/>the Belly, especially about the Navel, accompanied with Pains
          <lb/>more or less acute, as happen'd in the Cases mention'd by <hi>Roujsct,
          <lb/>Bauhine, Hildanus</hi> from <hi>Albucasis, Alexander. Benedictus</hi>, and
          <lb/>others ; as also in the Instance recorded by <hi>Cyprianus</hi>, that celebrated
          <lb/><hi>Dutch</hi> Physician, in <hi>Epist. de Hernia uterina</hi>-, and
          <lb/>in the Case describ'd in the Annals of the <hi>Julian</hi> Academy, sor
          <lb/>the Year I727; in which a Tumor and Abscess appear’d in
          <lb/>the Musculus Rectus, hard by the Navel, as happen’d in most</p>
        <p>of the soremention'd Cases; and,- upon opening the Tumor,
          <lb/>all the Bones os a perfect, but putrified Foetus were extracted.
          <lb/>These Bones are in my Custody, and the Mother is still alive.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In Cases os this Nature, I think the most proper Pisce sor
          <lb/>performing the Operation, is that which is indicated and pointed
          <lb/>out by Nature itself; fince under it, for the most pars, are
          <lb/>lodg’d heth the Foetus, and the corrupted Humours, which
          <lb/>- create fuch intolerable Pains to the miserable Mother. If,
          <lb/>then, such an Abscess should be already broken, as sometimes
          <lb/>happens, and if the Aperture in it should be too small, it is, as
          <lb/>in other Abscesses, to be sufficiently inlarg'd, either with a.
          <lb/>groov'd Prohe, and proper Knife ; or, instead of the Probe,
          <lb/>with the Finger and Knife, or with Scistars, or with that Knife
          <lb/>delineated in <hi>Tab</hi>. 26. <hi>Fig</hi>. 3.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Then the Bones of the Foetus left aster the Putrefaction of
          <lb/>the soft Parts, or whatever os a corrupted Nature is found
          <lb/>in it, are to be extracted, either with the Fingers, or with a
          <lb/>Pair of Forceps; the Vitiated Humors are to be evacuated, the
          <lb/>Ulcer is to be deterg'd by proper Medicines, and then conglutinated
          <lb/>by such Balsamics as are in like Cases directed by
          <lb/>skilful Surgeons. If there is as yet no Aperture in fuch aTu-</p>
        <p>mor of the Belly, but if Pains, and other bad Symptoms in and
          <lb/>about it afflict and weaken the Patient; and especially is to the
          <lb/>Touch there appears to be Pus in the Tumor as in Abscesses,
          <lb/>lest the Patient should suffer thereby, we must, after consulting
          <lb/>with other skilful Practitioners, make a sufficiently large
          <lb/>Incssion in the Abscess or Tumor, extract the Foetus, or its
          <lb/>Bones, if the Flesh he putrified, diflodge every thing of a corrupted
          <lb/>Nature, deterge the Ulcer, and agglutinate it in the </p>

        <p rend="indent">fnanner already directed. In the above-mention'd Cases, these
          <lb/>was no Occasion for Suture, but the Wounds gradually united
          <lb/>and healed in the <hi rend="u">sam</hi>e manner Other Abscesses do.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If the Foetus should he lodg'd in a certain uterine Hernia,
          <lb/>which rarely happens, tho' it occurred in the Case related by
          <lb/><hi>Sennertus</hi> and <hi>Hildanus</hi>-, a sussicientiy large Incision is to he
          <lb/>made in the Henna or Tumor itself, first thro' the Integuments,
          <lb/>then thro’ the Uterus, and, last of all, thro' the Membranes
          <lb/>Of the Foetus. Then the Foetus is to be extracted,
          <lb/>’and the Secundines are to he taken from the Uterus, which is
          <lb/>to he replac'd in the Belly, either immediately, if it can he
          <lb/>done. Or a few Days after, when it becomes less by its Contraction.
          <lb/>The other Steps to he taken are the fame with those
          <lb/>already directed. In the Case related by <hi>Sennertus</hi> and <hi>Hildanus</hi>,
          <lb/>the Surgeon did not replace the Uterus, but immediately
          <lb/>stitch'd up the Skin: Hence I believe it happen'd, that the
          <lb/>Uterus could not afterwards be replac'd, but the Mother died
          <lb/>a Month after, tho* the Foetus was alive and sound. It
          <lb/>had therefore heen hetter to heve omitted the Suture, and ret
          <lb/>plac'd the Uterus in the Belly fome Days after, when it had
          <lb/>become less by Contraction; for by this means the Mother
          <lb/>might have possibly been sav'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If Pieces of Bones belonging to a corrupted Foetus seek a
          <lb/>Passage hy the <hi>Intestinum Rectum</hi>, and <hi>Anus</hi>, which they sometimes
          <lb/>do, as is evident, not only from the Cases already
          <lb/>mention'd, but also from one which happen'd a few Years
          <lb/>ago in a neighbouring Village; upon such an Emergency,
          <lb/>the Splinters which come not away spontaneoufly are to be extracted
          <lb/>cautinufly, either with a proper Hook or Forceps;
          <lb/>and the Wound of the <hi>Intestinum Rectum</hi> is afterwards to be,
          <lb/>agglutinated with Balsamics. But these are Circumstances
          <lb/>which do not properly belong to the <hi>Cas.arean</hi> Section. But
          <lb/>if Coses of this Nature should occur, I advise the Surgeon to
          <lb/>read and compare what has been advanc'd upon this Subject,
          <lb/>by the above-quoted Authors, that he may at once be appris'd
          <lb/>of the Variety of Cafes of this kind, and qualified, for treating
          <lb/>them with the greater Skill and Judgment.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the third Place, the <hi>Cas.arean</hi> Section is to be perform'd
          <lb/>when the Mother and Foetus are still alive, but at the same
          <lb/>time the Foetus, on account of some Impediments, can neialter
          <lb/>be hern in the ordinary Manner, nor extracted, especially
          <lb/>when a bad Conformation of Parts in the Mother prevents
          <lb/>. the introduction of .the Surgeon's Hand for her Relies. . In
          <lb/>this deplorable State of Things, both Mother and Foetus mint
          <lb/>unavoidably perish, unless reliev'd by the Operation. Tho' in
          <lb/>Cases of this Kind, many Physicians and Surgeons are too timorous,
          <lb/>tho' many Women from a false Principle os Compassion,
          <lb/>or mistaken Notions of Religion, condemn the Operation
          <lb/>in these Circumstances as impious, tho' by it the Foetus,
          <lb/>or the Mother, and often both, might he preserv'd ; yet I
          <lb/>think it more prudent, and more agreeable to the Precepts of
          <lb/>Christianity, to undertake the Operation, where no other
          <lb/>Means of Relief can he found, than to destroy both Mother
          <lb/>and Foetus, for want <hi>of</hi> it; especially on Queens and Princesses,
          <lb/>where the Peace and Safety of Kingdoms and Nations
          <lb/>depend on the Preduction of a Successor, without which there
          <lb/>would he an unavoidable Foundation laid <hi>for the</hi> most cruel
          <lb/>Wars, Devastations of Cities, Robberies, Murder, and the
          <lb/>Subversion of States; for, by this Operation seasonably undertaken,
          <lb/>either the Mother, or the Foetus, or both, but most
          <lb/>frequently the Foetus, is preserv'd. The Lives of a great Number
          <lb/>of Soldiers are often exposed in the Field of Battle for the Good
          <lb/>of the State, without any Hesitation or Reserve; and, is Circumstances
          <lb/>require it, why should not the Life of one Woman
          <lb/>he risqu'd for the same End ? If therefore we think justly on
          <lb/>the Point, we shall have Reason to condemn as cruel, barbaxous,
          <lb/>and inhuman, thofe Very Physicians and Surgeons, who
          <lb/>thro' mistaken Views either delay the Operation, or dissuade
          <lb/>from it ;. especially when the Women themselves desire it should
          <lb/>he perform'd. .</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>Mauriceau</hi>, tho' a skilful Man-midwife, and an inveterate
          <lb/>Enemy to the <hi>Caesarean</hi> Section, yet gives an Instance of the
          <lb/>Foetus being preserv'd alive by it, tho' the Mother died ;
          <lb/>whereas, without it, both Mother and Child had unavoidably
          <lb/>perish'd; for, upon the Principles of common Sense, it is far
          <lb/>more eligible to save one, than to destroy both. The Operation
          <lb/>is to he perform'd in the same manner, as when the
          <lb/>Mother is alive, and the Foetus dead; only greater Caution is
          <lb/>to he used, lest, in opening the Uterus and Membranes, the
          <lb/>Foetus should be hurt or injur'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Bus, tho'. I heve only perform'd this Operation on dead
          <lb/>Women, yet I am so fully apprised of the Danger that attends
          <lb/>it, that I am sar from advifing it in Cases where there is the
          <lb/>least Probability of bringing, the Foetus away by the natural
          <lb/>Passages. <hi>Mauriceau</hi>, and others, seem to think, that some
          <lb/>Physicians advise the <hi>Cas.arean</hi> Section, where rhe Foetus can
          <lb/>he extracted thro' the common Passage; and, so far as I can
          <lb/>understand, they seem to helieVe, that some Physicians prefer
          <lb/>this Operation to the other gentle and natural Method. But
          <lb/>#tis scarce credible, that .2 prudent Physician or Surgeon</p>
        <p>should either adviie, or actually perform, the <hi>Cas.arean</hi> Section^
          <lb/>which is so dangerous on a live Woman, when there is a Possibility
          <lb/>of extracting the Foetus thro' the Vagins, tho' it should
          <lb/>only be brought away in Pieces, except in some particular
          <lb/>Cafes upon Queens or Princesses, where Interests of State,
          <lb/>and the manifest Good of the Community, require it. Whenever
          <lb/>it happens then, that the Foetus, either on account of its
          <lb/>unnatural Situation .in the Womb, its excessive Bulk, especially
          <lb/>that of the Head, the monstrous Conformation of its
          <lb/>Body, or some other Cause, cannot he born, tho' at the
          <lb/>same time it is contain'd in the Uterus, and when there is an
          <lb/>evident Danger of the Mother's Death, as well as that Of the
          <lb/>Foetus, in consequence of her Strength heing exhausted ; if
          <lb/>on such Occasions there should arise a Dispute, whether, in order
          <lb/>to preserve the Foetus, the Operation should he perform'd
          <lb/>on the Mother, or whether the Foetus ought not rather to be
          <lb/>extracted with Instruments, if it cannot otherwise be done 5
          <lb/>I think the Mother is to be preserv'd, and the Foetus, even
          <lb/>tho' alive, to be extracted by any Means. In this Sentiment 1
          <lb/>am supported by the Judgments of many Physicians, Surgeons,
          <lb/>and Divines, who, in Cases of difficult Births, where 'tis impossible
          <lb/>to save both Mother and Foetus, lay it down as a
          <lb/>Maxim, that the Life of the Mother is to be preferrfd to that
          <lb/>of the Child ; or, as they express it, the Tree before the
          <lb/>Branch. I am also of Opinion with <hi>Balingen</hi> and <hi>la Mattes</hi>
          <lb/>that if a Callus of the Vagina, or Mouth of the Womb, be
          <lb/>the Cause why the Foetus cannot be brought away, and if
          <lb/>these Parts can he sufficiently dilated, either by Section or
          <lb/>Dilaceration, that this latter Method should*be prefer'd <hi>to</hi>
          <lb/>the <hi>Caesarean</hi> Section ; because by this Method the Belly and
          <lb/>the Uterus itself are left entire, and the Blood discharg'd
          <lb/>flows all thro' the Vagina, but in the other Cose is thrown into .
          <lb/>the Abdomen, and considerably endangers Lise. Besides other
          <lb/>Advantages attending this Method, the Wound is also more easily
          <lb/>agglutinated in it than in the other. I also think, that,
          <lb/>when the Vagina is shut up by the Hymen, or any other
          <lb/>Membrane, these are to be cut rather than the Belly and UteI
          <lb/>rus: But when the Vagina is cover'd with too large and . hard
          <lb/>a Callus to admit of a sufficient Dilatation, and especially
          <lb/>where there is an originally bad Conformation of the Bones
          <lb/>Of the Pelvis, then the <hi>Cas.arean</hi> Section is to be had recourse
          <lb/>to as the only Method os Relief</p>
        <p rend="indent">In like manner; is; by the Pains and Efforts made during
          <lb/>Labour, the Uterus should be broken, and the Foetus flip into
          <lb/>the Cavity of the Belly, aS sometimes happens, the Belly is
          <lb/>in - this Cafe to he laid open, fince without such an Operatiori
          <lb/>the Foetus could not - be extracted, and consequently neither
          <lb/>it nor the Mother preserv'd. It may be known by the following
          <lb/>Signs, when this happens to be the Cose : If Violent Pains,
          <lb/>by which the Child is not forc'd into the World, are remitted,
          <lb/>or cease all of a sudden, the Mouth os the Uterus in the
          <lb/>mean time not being open, or at least not sussicientiy oneri
          <lb/>for the Purpose; a Circumstance which denotes the preternatural
          <lb/>Situation of the Child ; if a certain Rupture Or
          <lb/>Fragor is perceiv'd in the Belly 5 if a Shivering succeeds ; if
          <lb/>a large Tumor afterwards appears, and the Foetus in.
          <lb/>perceiv'd to he situated higher in the Belly, than hefore ;
          <lb/>if the Parts or Members of the1 Foetus are more distinctly
          <lb/>felt than when ft was in the Uterus, especially if it is
          <lb/>felt in either of the Hypochondria, with Pains in another
          <lb/>Part of the Belly than before; as also, if the Patient is
          <lb/>seiz'd with fainting Fits, convulsive Motions, or perhaps Alienation
          <lb/>of Mind. When these Symptoms attend a difficult
          <lb/>Birth, when no Part‘of the Foetus appears externally, and
          <lb/>when, upon passing the Finger thro' the Vagina, it is not
          <lb/>sound to press so strongly on the Mouth os the Uterus, we
          <lb/>may conclude, that the Uterus is burst, and the Foetus siipt into
          <lb/>the Cavity of the Abdomen. If this should happen to he the
          <lb/>Case, the Belly of the Mother is to be open’d in the most
          <lb/>prominent Part, where the Child is sound to be lodg'd, with
          <lb/>a View to save the Lives, if not of both, yet at least of the
          <lb/>Foetus. When the Arm hangs out of the Rupture of the
          <lb/>Uterus, 'tis a bad Symptom, and a Cure is in this Case very
          <lb/>difficult, if not impossible; however, we must prognosticate
          <lb/>from the concomitant Symptoms. I am surpris’d, that the
          <lb/>Physicians and Surgeons belonging to the <hi>Strasburg</hi> Hospital,
          <lb/>in which a Patient had been in Labour for five Days, and
          <lb/>whose Case is recorded by <hi>Pistor</hi>,, should have delay'd laying
          <lb/>her open, fince eVen during her Life they had the most manifest
          <lb/>and incontestable Proofs, that the Uterus was burst; or, if
          <lb/>they were afraid to perform the Operation on a live Woman,
          <lb/>why did they not lay open her Belly after her Death, in order,
          <lb/>if possible, to save the Lise of the Foetus? The Case of <hi>Saward</hi>
          <lb/>is also worthy of our Attention, when in the <hi>sesotel
          <lb/>Dieu</hi> the Foetus, in consequence of a Rupture os the Uterus,
          <lb/>had fallen into the Abdomen, the Secundines Jo the mean
          <lb/>time hanging out of the Vagina. This he knew to he the
          <lb/>Case, as he himself informs uS, by introducing his Hand into
          <lb/>the Uterus by the Navel-string. Notwithstanding these Circumstances,
          <lb/>he did not open the Woman alive, in order to save </p>
        <pb n="129"/>
        <p rend="indent">the Child, and perhaps the Mother too, but suffer’d them to
          <lb/>die together.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If the Foetus should happen to be generated in the Cavity
          <lb/>of the Belly, and not in the Uterus, (a rare Case) which
          <lb/>Inay be known from the preceding general Signs of Pregnancy,
          <lb/>from the Foetus being situated higher in the Belly than is
          <lb/>Usual, and from the Mouth of the Uterus being clofed at the
          <lb/>fcxpectsd Time of Dellvery, even when there are Pains, and
          <lb/>some other Symptoms already mentioned ; in this Cafe the Ciesarean
          <lb/>Section ought to be performed, because the Ftetus can,not
          <lb/>otherwise he preserved; and, besides, the Mother is in less
          <lb/>imminent Danger, because there is no Necessity for making an
          <lb/>Incssion in the Uterus. Sometimes, in difficult Labours, the
          <lb/>Uterus is burst in such a manner, that not the whole Foetus,
          <lb/>but only fome Part of it, falls into the Abdomen, the rest
          <lb/>remaining in the Uterus. The Arm, for Instance, may hang
          <lb/>Out of the Vagina, whilst the Head-or Feet are fallen through
          <lb/>the Rupture of the Uterus into the Cavity of the Abdomen; in
          <lb/>this Cafe the Caesarean Section is not necessary. Thus I
          <lb/>myself sound the Arms of a Foetus out of the Uterus,
          <lb/>whilst the Head was in the Abdomen, and the rest of the Body
          <lb/>in the Uterus. <hi>Albinus</hi> and <hi>La Motte</hi> faw a Cafe, in which
          <lb/>the Head of the Foetus was duly lodg’d in the Vagina, whilst its'
          <lb/>Feet had perforated the Uterus, and stuck in the Belly near the
          <lb/>Diaphragm. Another Cine they make mention os, where the
          <lb/>Arm was hanging out of the vagina, whllst the Feet were in
          <lb/>the Abdomen. In both Cafes the Patients were excessively
          <lb/>weak. <hi>La Motte</hi> brought away the Foetuses in the natural manner
          <lb/>; but both Mothers died a sew Days after. But an Instance
          <lb/>directiy opposite to these was told me by <hi>Rungius</hi>, a Surgeon of
          <lb/><hi>Bremen</hi>, in which, after heving brought away the Fretus,
          <lb/>- . though, through the Rupture of the Uterus, he plainly felt the
          <lb/>Intestines of the Patient, and with his Hand kept them for
          <lb/>some time from rushing into the Uterus till it contracted itself,
          <lb/>yet the Patient happily recover’d.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But I must nor forget to make mention of the Difference
          <lb/>between <hi>Hysterotomy</hi>, and what is commonly called <hi>Embryulcia ;</hi>
          <lb/>or between extracting the Foetus, especially if unnaturally situated,
          <lb/>from the Uterus, through the natural Passage, and cut'
          <lb/>tiog it out, by making an Incision in the Belly and Uterus ;
          <lb/>hecaufe often by the Vulgar, and even, which is more surprising,
          <lb/>by fome of the Learned, as allo by Physicians themselves, these
          <lb/>two Operations are confounded, and taken for each other, tho’
          <lb/>nothing can be more different; for when the Foetus is extracts!
          <lb/>from any Woman, nothing is more ordinary than to fay, that '
          <lb/>her Child has been cut from her, though there was no manner
          <lb/>of Section made, ’either on the Belly or the-Uterus ., but only
          <lb/>the Child, on account of its unnatural Position, or its excessive
          <lb/>Bulk, has been brought away by the Vagina, either by the
          <lb/>Hands of the Surgeon, or fome proper instruments. This
          <lb/>Operation, therefore, by which the Foetus is extracted through
          <lb/>the natural Passage, is called <hi>Embryulcia</hi> ; but thet whereby it
          <lb/>is cut from the Belly <hi>Hiasterotomy</hi>,. or the <hi>Caesarean Section.</hi>
          <lb/>And if in this Senfe <hi>Embryulcia</hi>, or the Extraction of the Foetus
          <lb/>through the natural Passage, is falsiy taken for <hi>Hysterotomy</hi>, it
          <lb/>is, perheps, in some measure, true, which is advanced by
          <lb/><hi>Scipio Mercurius, <hi rend="sup">li</hi></hi> That Exsection os the Foetus was, in his
          <lb/>" Time, as customary in <hi>France</hi>, as Venesection in <hi>Italy</hi> for</p>
        <p rend="indent">Head-ache.” Thus, when I was lately perusing the Otherrations
          <lb/>of <hi>Franciseus Valleriala</hi>, I found one, concerning Mothers,
          <lb/>who were happlly cured, and lived after the Foetus had
          <lb/>been cut from them by the Hand of the Surgeon. I expected to
          <lb/>sind many remarkable Instances of the Cndarean Section being
          <lb/>happily and successfully performed, and perhaps a particular
          <lb/>Method of performing it, not mentioned by others. But after I
          <lb/>hed run over the whole Observation, I found, indeed, several
          <lb/>Cases where the Foetus had been extracted by Hooks, or the
          <lb/>Hand of the Surgeon; but not a single instance of the true Caesarean
          <lb/>Section being once performed. So that ’tis plain, thet
          <lb/>not Only the Vulgar, but also learned Men and Physicians,
          <lb/>have often mistaken one of these Operations for the other, as
          <lb/>did alfo <hi>C. Bauhine</hi>, though they differ very widely from each
          <lb/>ether. But by this unjust and unaccurate Way of speaking, a
          <lb/>false Horror is often excited in Patients, aS if the Belly was to,
          <lb/>be laid open, so soon as the Surgeon applies his Hand, in order
          <lb/>to assist in a difficult Birth, though he sometimes performs his
          <lb/>Business, without creating much Pain to the Patient.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As the monstrous Foetuses, with two Heads, or two
          <lb/>Bedies, cannot, for the most part, he hern entire, without
          <lb/>' performing the Caesarean Section on their Mothers, *tis disputed
          <lb/>whether, for their fakes, the Caesarean Operation ought to be
          <lb/>performed, and the Life of the Mother thereby exposed to imminent
          <lb/>Danger , or whether the Foetus, if it cannot be had
          <lb/>entire, ought not rather to be cut in Pieces, and brought away
          <lb/>piece-meal, through the natural Passages, in this. Cafe,, because
          <lb/>these Monsters are either not alive, or, for the moshpart,
          <lb/>horrid and uselefs Loads and Incumbrances to the Earth, I think
          <lb/>the Mother is to be spared, and the monstrous Foetus to be extrailed
          <lb/>by Instruments of wherever Kind. <hi>Meili</hi>, a late <hi>Italian</hi>
          <lb/>Writer, condemns the Cssarean.Beitinn on a living Mother;</p>
        <p>and not sufficiently viewing the several Reasons thet may induce
          <lb/>to this Operation, he inconsiderately asks, whether, for the
          <lb/>sake of a Monster, the Life of the Mother ought to be exposed
          <lb/>to the greatest Danger ; hut fof this very Reason he justly adviles,
          <lb/>that the Monster should be brought away by any means,
          <lb/>thro’ the natural Passage. But since there are other Cases which
          <lb/>require this Operation, where the Fcetus cannot be brought
          <lb/>away through the natural Passages, I think it cannot, with a
          <lb/>safe Conscience, be neglected, as ! have already shewn:</p>
        <p rend="indent">If the Head of the Fcetus, either <hi>by</hi> its own Largeness, or
          <lb/>the Narrowness of the natural Passage, sticks in the internal
          <lb/>Mouth of the Uterus, or in the Vagina ; if from its long Continuance
          <lb/>there the Foetus dies, which generally happens in three
          <lb/>' Days, though it sometimes lives longer ; and, in consequence
          <lb/>of this Accident, the Lives both of the Mother and Fcetus are
          <lb/>exposed to imminent Danger, because the Hand of the Surgeon
          <lb/>can neither be introduced to alter the Position, nor the Foetus
          <lb/>expend ; this is justly look’d upon as the most difficult and important
          <lb/>Case in Midwifery. As the Head of the Fcetus cannot
          <lb/>he held, in consequence of its Sliopenness, and the Narrowness
          <lb/>of the Passage, as the Hand cannot be introduced to alter its
          <lb/>Position in the Uterus, and as no instrument can lay hold of it
          <lb/>without killing the Fcetus, it is- by fome made a Question,
          <lb/>whether the Caesarean Section ought to be'performed, in order
          <lb/>to preserve the Fcetus ; for unless the Child.is quickly1 relieved
          <lb/>from this Imprisonment, it must not only die very soon, but
          <lb/>the Life of the Mother must he exposed to certain Danger; so
          <lb/>thet with <hi>La Motte</hi>, and <hi>Sigisenunda</hi>, I must own this to he at.
          <lb/>once the most deplorable and intricate Case that can possibly
          <lb/>occur to a Surgeon. ’Tis the Opinion of most of the abovementioned
          <lb/>Authors, that neither the Cadarean Section ought to
          <lb/>, be performed, nor the Child dismember’d, whilst either Mother
          <lb/>or Foetus are alive; but, with the superstitious Cafuists of the
          <lb/><hi>Raman</hi> Church, they are for allowing both to perish, rather
          <lb/>than for preserving one at the Expence of the other.. In this
          <lb/>Case they absolutely condemn the Caesarean Section, r.otwithe
          <lb/>' standing the many Instances recorded of both Mother and Foetus
          <lb/>surviving the Operation, which, we are told, by <hi>Roonhuys,.vtzs</hi>
          <lb/>performed seven times by <hi>Sonneus</hi>, a Physician at <hi>Bruges,</hi>
          <lb/>upon bis own Wife, and both Mother and Foetus were preserved
          <lb/>each time. . The cclebtated <hi>Glaus Rudbeck</hi> is also faid to
          <lb/>have performed the Operation with Success on his own Wife,
          <lb/>the Foetus also surviving. <hi>Hiister’s Surgery</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the Case last-mentioned, there is no Possibility ofa Necese
          <lb/>sity for the Caesarean Section. , The Methods of extracting the
          <lb/>Fcetus under these Circumstances are specify’d in the proper
          <lb/>Place.</p>
        <p><hi>. Hicifier</hi> proceeds to inform us, that, in his Opinion, it is
          <lb/>both prudent and lawful to bring the Fcetus away, in order'to
          <lb/>save the Mother’s Lise, though it should nor be really dead. It,*
          <lb/>however, requires great Judgment to determine when this is to
          <lb/>be attempted, and when nor; though, to speak Truth, there
          <lb/>feldom can be any -Necessity of destroying the Child in this
          <lb/>Situation.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There is something extremely ridiculous, in the Advice given
          <lb/>by several Medicinal Authors, of the Catholic Religion, as well
          <lb/>as Divines, which is, to baptize ths Child’ in the Wornb, by
          <lb/>the Help of a Syringe, when any Danger is apprehended of its *
          <lb/>dying in the Birth j as if it was worth while to keep the Mother

          <lb/>should punish the Chi’d for the Omission or Crime committed

          <lb/>grow upon the Upper Part of the Branches, on each Side the '
          <lb/>Stalks, but sew in Number, several growing on one common
          <lb/>Foot-stalk; besides which, they have each a shorter of their

          <lb/>Colour, labiated and galeated ; and are succeeded each by four
          <lb/>smell Seeds, lying at the Bottom of the Calyx. The Root is
          <lb/>fmall and fibrous. The Leaves and Flowers have a pleasant aromatic
          <lb/>Smell, somewhat like wild Mint; We have two Species
          <lb/>of this <hi>Calamint</hi>, whereof one has Flowers almost as big as the
          <lb/>other. They are both sound together by Hedges, and Highway

        <p rend="indent">This Plant is full of an aromatic, oily, volatile Salt. It is
          <lb/>stomachic, diuretic, aperitive, and provokes the Menses. It
          <lb/>must be used after the manner of Tea. The Decoction of it,
          <lb/>given in a Clyster, asswages the Colic, resolves oedematous Tumors,
          <lb/>and strengthens the Parts. <hi>Martyn’s Tournefort</hi>. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">This Herb probably has its Name from the two <hi>Greek</hi> Words,
          <lb/>καλἀ μίνὐη, which signify <hi>good Mint</hi> ; for the <hi>Calarnintha vulgaris</hi>,
          <lb/>or <hi>common Calandnt</hi>, not only agrees with Mint in its
          <lb/>Virtues, but also resembles it pretty much in Smell. <hi>Calandnt</hi>
          <lb/>is an aromatic Herb, which, by the grateful Fragrance of its
          <lb/>Effluvia, rouses the Spiriof, and gently warms the Nerves of
          <lb/>him who sinells is. What grows in the Mountains has not only
          <lb/>a more agreeable Smell, but is also thought more proper sot
          <lb/>medicinal Purposes, than what is produced elsewhere. The
          <lb/>Antients extol’d it for its heatiog, alexipbarmac, refolvent, and
          <lb/>diseutient Qualities; and prescrib’d not only the external, but
          <lb/>also the internal, Qfe of it, asserting, that it kill’d Worms.
          <lb/>‘It is an Ingredient in the <hi>Theriaca</hi>, and such other Preparations,
          <lb/>. as go under the general Name of Antidotes, internally, it is
          <lb/>most properly ufed in "Infusions, in.Cases where a Snmulus is
          <lb/>required. It is proper for phlegmatic Constitutions, and such
          <lb/>as arc afflictsd with Flatulencies ; but it is principally conducive
          <lb/>' to the Relief of Women labouring under Obstructions of the
          <lb/>Uterus, a violent <hi>Fluor albus</hi>, or a catarrhous Disorder of the
          <lb/>Womb. According to <hi>Etmuller</hi>,. it is so powerful a Provoker
          <lb/>of the Menses, that it even excites them in Women big with
          <lb/>Child, and kills the Foetus. It is also said to expel the Lochia,.
          <lb/>Secundines, and Fcetus. It is an excellent and a mild Diuretic, oleanfes
          <lb/>Ulcers of the Kidneys, and cures Discharges of bloody
          <lb/>Urine in Asthmas and Orthopnoeas, whether arising from a
          <lb/>Defcft of the Stomach, or Ulcers of the Lungs, it is of excellent
          <lb/>Service, if helled with Oxymel. But it ought not to be exhibited
          <lb/>to fuch as have no Occasion for an additional Stimulus 5
          <lb/>for it acts by producing a Heat, which, though small, is nevertheless
          <lb/>often found prejudicial to the Asthmatic, to such as discharge
          <lb/>a bloody Urine; nor will it always agree in Ulcerations
          <lb/>of the Lungs. But where the languid andtelaxed Fibres are to
          <lb/>he stimulated, or the sluggish Humours roused into a brisker
          <lb/>Motion, <hi>Calamint</hi> will be' found' of singular Use and Irnportance
          <lb/>; and,, upon these Considerations, it is justly rank’d
          <lb/>among the several Classes of cordial, alexipbarmac, stomachic,
          <lb/>carminative, uterine, and emmenagogue Medicines; for this
          <lb/>Reason ’tis alfo used in Clysters, Cataplasms, Fomentations,'
          <lb/>and such Baths, as are intended for the Purposes of Resolution,
          <lb/>Discussion, and provoking the Menses. An Ounce, or an
          <lb/>Ounce and an half, of the distil’d Water of <hi>Calamint</hi>, may be
          <lb/>given for the same Intentions with the Herb itself; but ’tis
          <lb/>rarely used, on account of its ungrateful Taste. The <hi>Syrupus

          <lb/>Calamint, consists of other Aromatics, and Raisins, with
          <lb/>which, after they are boiled in Water, Honey is mixed. This
          <lb/>Syrup, being of an aperient Quality, is recommended in Obstructions
          <lb/>of the Vifccra; and its Dofe may he an Ounce and
          <lb/>an half. Besides this Syrup, there are other two Preparations

          <lb/>Compositions, differing in the Proportions of their ingredients,
          <lb/>but agree in this, that they consist almost of the fame Aroma-</p>

          <lb/>Calamint, as are required for preparing the <hi>Electuapium de Ca~

          <lb/>only as serviceable to the Stomach and intestines, but also as
          <lb/>useful in provoking Urine and the Menses j and curing chto..
          <lb/>nical Diseases, by correcting the Chyle, and consequently punlying

        <p rend="indent">The Calcaneum, or Os Calcis, is the largest Bone os the
          <lb/>Foot, os which It makes the posterior Part, and, in some measure,
          <lb/>the Basis. It is oblong, and very irregular, and may he
          <lb/>divided into a Body, and two Apophyses, one great and anterior,
          <lb/>the other small, lateral, and internal.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Body of the Os Calcis has fix Sides, one posterior, one
          <lb/>anterior, one superior, one inferior, and two lateral.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The posterior Side is broad, unequally convex, and, aS it
          <lb/>were, divided into two Portions ; one superior, small, and polish'd
          <lb/>; the other inferior, much larger, unequal, and rough,
          <lb/>which, in Children, is an Epiphysis, and may be named the
          <lb/>Tuberosity of the OS Calcis. The lower Part of it is bent
          <lb/>downward, and terminates in two Tubercles, or obtuse Points,
          <lb/>which belong rather to the inferior than to the posterior Side of
          <lb/>the Bone.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The upper -Side may be divided into two Parts,, one posterior
          <lb/>and unequal, having a small Depression; the other anterior,convex,
          <lb/>and cartilaginous, proportion’d to the great inferior
          <lb/>Cavity of the <hi>Astragalus</hi>. This Side is turn'd obliquely forward,
          <lb/>and by this Obliquity hecomes Part of the fore Side,
          <lb/>the remaining Part of which is lost in the anterior Apophysis.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The lower Side is narrow, and behind it lie the two Tubercles,
          <lb/>os which the internal is the biggest. They both serve for
          <lb/>the Insertion of the Aponeurosis in the Soal of the Foot, but
          <lb/>principally the biggest.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The two lateral Sides are continued over the anterior Apophysis.
          <lb/>The external is gently convex and unequal, cover'd j
          <lb/>only by the common Integuments and Ligaments. The internal
          <lb/>is hollow'd and depress’d. . . <hi rend="sup">w</hi></p>
        <p rend="indent">The great or anterior Apophysis lies in the same Direction
          <lb/>with the Body, heing a Continuation thereof. It has five Sides,
          <lb/><hi>l</hi> or remarkable Parts; and, were st not for the Body, it would
          <lb/>have a sixth. .</p>
        <p rend="indent">The upper Side has an irregular and unequal Depression,
          <lb/>which, together with that in the Apophysis of the <hi>Astragalus,</hi>
          <lb/>forms a considerable Fossula. At its anterior Extremity there
          <lb/>is a small cartilaginous Surface, answering to one of those in the
          <lb/>Apophysis of the <hi>Astragalus</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The anterior Side of the Apophysis is broad, oblique, carti.
          <lb/>laginous, partly convex, and partly concave, and articulated,
          <lb/>with a littie Surface of the <hi>Os Cuboides</hi>. This is the fore Side
          <lb/>of the whole <hi>0s Calcis</hi>, when considered without any Divi-fion.
          <lb/></p>
        <p rend="indent">The Outside of the Apophysis is very rough, being a Continuation
          <lb/>of the outer Side of the Body, with a Tubercle or
          <lb/>Eminence at' the Place where these two Sides meet, which,
          <lb/>however, is not found in all Subjects. On the lower Part of
          <lb/>this Tubercle is a cartilaginous Surface, for the Passage of the
          <lb/>Tendon of the <hi>Peronatus Longus</hi> : Sometimes we see only some
          <lb/>small Vestiges of this Eminence, and often none at all. We
          <lb/>sometimes meet with another small cartilaginous Surface lower
          <lb/>down, and more forward, near the anterior Extremity of the
          <lb/>Apophysis, for the Passage of the same Tendon. The lower.
          <lb/>Side is a Tuberosity, continued from the Side of the Body, and
          <lb/>designed for the Insertion of Muscles.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The lateral Apophysis is almost common to the Body, and to
          <lb/>the great anterior Apophysis, and increases the Cavity on the
          <lb/>Inside of the Os Calcis. On its upper Part it has a very smooth
          <lb/>cartilaginous Surface, articulated with one of the inferior Surfaces
          <lb/>of the Astragalus.. This Apophysis is very low down,
          <lb/>and its inferior Part is smooth for the Passage of Tendons.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Os Calcis has four Cartilages, of which three are superior,
          <lb/>one large, and two small, for its triple Articulation with
          <lb/>the <hi>Astragalus</hi> ; the fourth is anterior, for the <hi>Os Cuboides</hi>. To
          <lb/>these must be added a small thin Cartilage, of a kind Of ligamentary

        <p rend="indent"><hi>Alexander Trallianus</hi> relates a Case of a Person who cough'd
          <lb/>up a Stone; and I know a Lady, now alive, who was thought ’
          <lb/>many Years ago to be in a deep Consumption; but, upon
          <lb/>coughing up <hi>a</hi> Stone, near as large as a small Nutmeg, she recover'd
          <lb/>her Health perfectly. Dr. <hi>Frtind</hi> says. That of such
          <lb/>Stones,- cough'd up, he had seen several, and some aS big aS a
          <lb/>Filbert, where no Signs of a Consumption appear'd, only there
          <lb/>continued an inveterate Cough. One he knew, who had
          <lb/>brought up sour or five such, at long Distances of Time.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We may therefore conceive, that if any small indissoluble
          <lb/>Substance is fix'd in any Part of the Body whatever, a stony
          <lb/>Crust soon forms itself upon it, either more or less. If such a
          <lb/>Concretion os the earthy Parts os the Blood happens at the
          <lb/>Extremities os the Urinary Ducts, where they open into the
          <lb/>Kidneys, and forms a small Grain of Sand, hence arises the
          <lb/>Stone in the Kidneys, which, increasing daily, in time grows
          <lb/>considerable enough to incommode and obstruct the Kidneys,
          <lb/>and bring away a Part of its Substance in the Form of grumous
          <lb/>Concretions, PuS, Caruncles,. or Skins, till at last it corrupts
          <lb/>the Whole, exciting bloody, pundent, and fetid Urine; and
          <lb/>sometimes an Inflammation, and consequent Exulceration, of
          <lb/>the adjacent Parts.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When this is by any Couse whatever remov'd from its native Place
          <lb/>into the Pelvis of the Kidney, and from thence into any
          <lb/>Part of the Course of the Ureter, or itS Entrance into the
          <lb/>Bladder, it frequentiy intercepts the Urine, and causes an acute
          <lb/>inflammatory Pain.</p>
        <p rend="indent">When the Stone is convey'd into the Bladder thro' the Ureters,
          <lb/>it is often esTel'd from thence, and discharg'd by the
          <lb/>Urethra. But, is it remains in the Bladder, the earthy Parts
          <lb/>Of the Urine adhere to it, and increase its Bulk, forming upon
          <lb/>it Various Strata, which are sometimes red, sometimes white,ash-colourfd,
          <lb/>or azure, the Nucleus which sen from the Kidneys
          <lb/>always remaining red. And it appears, by Chymical Experiments

        <p rend="indent">The Kidneys are of a glandulous Consistence, and of a red
          <lb/>Colour, in which respect they are more like the Liver than the
          <lb/>Breasts or Testicles; for these, tho' glandular Substances, are <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
          <lb/>more white. The Shape of the Kidneys is like that of the
          <lb/>Testicles, only flatter, and more incurvated. Within them
          <lb/>are small narrow Sinuses, which serve for the Percolation of
          <lb/>Urine; and from them proceed two nervous Ducts, one from
          <lb/>each Kidney, like Pipes, which are inserted into the Bladder,
          <lb/>one on each Side, and convey the Urine, by equal Passages, on
          <lb/>each'Side, from the Kidneys to the Bladder.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Kidneys, and their Canals, or Ducts; before-mention'd,
          <lb/>are subject to many and Various Disorders, some of which are
          <lb/>acute, and destroy the Patient in a short time;. such are Haemorrhages,
          <lb/>Fevers, and Inflammations; others are chronical,
          <lb/>but mortal and incurable, and, after long wasting the Body,
          <lb/>come to one common Period with the Lise of the Patient.. Of
          <lb/>this kind are Abscesses, Ulcers, Stone, and, from hence,,
          <lb/>bloody Urine. Ulcers proceed from Abscesses, hut are always
          <lb/>extremely tedious, and difficult of Cure.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Generation of Stones is very flow, but the Fit Very
          <lb/>painful, from the Obstruction os the Passages ; and, which is
          <lb/>the most dismal Circumstance, the Urine is suppressed. If
          <lb/>many small Stones,- compressed together, or but one great
          <lb/>Stone, stop up the Passage, and this be the Case with respect
          <lb/>to both Kidneys, Death must necessarily follow in a few Days,
          <lb/>from the Suppression of the Urine, and the Distention of the
          <lb/>Parts. Nature, indeed, has taken care to form the Sinuses of
          <lb/>the Kidneys of an oblong Figure, and of equal Capacity with
          <lb/>the Ureters, and larger than small Stones, with an Intent that
          <lb/>if such Concretions should be generated in the upper Parts,
          <lb/>they might find an easy Descent into the Bladder. For the
          <lb/>same Reason the Stones are of an oblong Figure, fince they are
          <lb/>generally found sucking in the Ureters 5 and such as are os an </p>
        <pb n="134"/>
        <p>uneven Bigness, are Sender in the sore Part, because of the
          <lb/>Narrowness of the Ureters, but thicker in the hinder Part, hecause
          <lb/>the Kidneys discharge themselves downwards. The
          <lb/>Stones are generated only in the Kidneys, and that when very
          <lb/>much distempered with Heat, and have no Seat in the Ureters ;
          <lb/>into which, however, the Gravel falling, is both a Sign, and
          <lb/>the Matter, of the Disease, if the Sinus of the Kidney be obstructed
          <lb/>with a Stone of considerable Bigness, there arises a Pain
          <lb/>in the Loins aheut the Muscles call'd <hi>Psoa</hi>, which extends itself
          <lb/>to the middle Rib, so as to cause the Disease to be oftentimes
          <lb/>.mistaken sor a Pleurisy ; there is a Sense of Weight upon the
          <lb/>Hip ; the Patient bends forwards with Difficulty, and can scarcely
          <lb/>move his Back; he labours under severe Gripings, which are
          <lb/>attended with a Sensation of Heaviness, and remove from one
          <lb/>Place to another, because of the Convolutions of the Intestine.
          <lb/>If there be a Redundancy of Urine, the Parts are distended,
          <lb/>and the Patient is tormented with a Desire to make Water, like
          <lb/>a Woman in Travail. He becomes fill'd with Flatulencies,
          <lb/>which are not readily discharg'd ; a biting and dry Fever seizes
          <lb/>him; his Tongue is parch’d, his Belly constipated,, and his
          <lb/>Body wasted ; he l oaths all Food, or, if he takes any Sustenance,
          <lb/>it is with great Difficulty that he digesta it, or receives
          <lb/>any Refreshment from it. If a Stone salis into an Ureter, it
          <lb/>raises a Shivering, aS from Cold, and the Progress of the Stone
          <lb/>is felt, attended with a Violent Pain.. If a Stone sells into the</p>
        <p>Bladder, there is a plentiful Discharge of aqueous Urine, the
          <lb/>Belly is evacuated. Flatulencies are expel'd, the Stomach is
          <lb/>easy, there are Eructations, and the Patient is freed from these
          <lb/>Evils which before molested him. If the Ureter be lacerated
          <lb/>by the Stone, Blood sometimes passes off with the Urine. Another
          <lb/>Pain commences, when the Stone passes thro' the Urethra
          <lb/>; for, if it is larger than that Canal, it is there detained
          <lb/>for a long time ;-mean while the Bladder is sill'd, and there is
          <lb/>a total Suppression of the Urine, attended with a most torment-</p>
        <p>ing Pain ; for even the Ureters are full The crooked Stones are
          <lb/>most painful in their Passage ; for I have seen some which have
          <lb/>bended like a Hook, and have observ’d Callosities in the Urethra
          <lb/>; but these Stones are, for the most part, form'd into an
          <lb/>oblong Figure, according to the Shape of the Passage. As to
          <lb/>the Colour of these Stones, some are white, like Chalk, and
          <lb/>these are commonly sound in Children ; others are yellow, like
          <lb/>Saffron, and generally afflict old Persons, who are also most
          <lb/>subject to the Stone in the Kidneys, as Children ure to the Stone
          <lb/>in the Bladder. There are two Causes of the Concretion of
          <lb/>these Stones: In aged Persons, the Coldness os their Bodies,
          <lb/>andtheThickness of these Blood ; sor Cold soonest causes a Concretion
          <lb/>of thick Matter. A Proof of this is, that the Waters
          <lb/>of naturally hot Springs are by Cold congeal'd into a callous
          <lb/>sort of Stone. In Children, -the Generation of the Stone is</p>
        <p>owing to much siimy Matter, which the Blond, like Fire, torrefies,
          <lb/>and reduces to a stony Consistence. Such are the Disorders
          <lb/>which are consequent to the Generation of a Stone.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Some, at certain Seasons, make bloody Urine, in which respect
          <lb/>this Disease is like the Haemorrhoids, and induces a like
          <lb/>Habit of Body. Persons thus affected are of a pale Colour,
          <lb/>lazy, unfit for Business, and have neither Appetite nor Digestion.
          <lb/>After their periodical Haemorrhage, they become languid
          <lb/>and paralytic in their Limbs, but lighter and freer in their
          <lb/>Heads: But, if they miss their usual Evacuation, they are
          <lb/>troubled with a Pain in the: Head, a Dimness of Sight, a Scotomia,.
          <lb/>and Vertigo; whence many hecome epileptic, others
          <lb/>bloated, blind, and hydropical; others grow melancholy, or
          <lb/>paralytic r And these are the Effects which proceed from a Retention
          <lb/>of the Blood which used to be evacuated. If the Blond
          <lb/>Sows from the Kidneys, it is usually discharg'd pure, and unmix'd
          <lb/>with the Urine, out of the Bladder. Sometimes it rushes
          <lb/>on a sudden, in a full Stream, from a Rupture of the Kidneys,
          <lb/>and congeals into Clots ; sometimes it congeals in the Bladder,
          <lb/>as if it were out of the Body, and thereby causes a terrible Suppression
          <lb/>of Urine. A Rupture is succeeded by inveterate and
          <lb/>stubborn Ulcers. The Signs of an Ulcer are, the Vending of a
          <lb/>Coat, or thin reddish Membrane, like a Spider's Web, or white
          <lb/>Pus with the Urine, sometimes pure and.unmix'd, and, at other
          <lb/>times, mix'd with the Urine. The Signs of the Formation of</p>
        <p rend="indent">an Abscess are, a Fever and Shiverings in the Evening, with
          <lb/>Pains .and Itchings about the Loins. An Abscess is known to
          <lb/>he broken by the coming off of purulent fleshy Clots, and
          <lb/>white Pus. The Ulcers are of the biting Kind, and sometimes
          <lb/>pure, sometimes soul, which is known by the Pus, and from
          <lb/>the Urine having sometimes an ill Smell, at other times none
          <lb/>at all.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Spring generates Haemorrhages and Abscesses; the
          <lb/>Winter and Autumn, the Stone and Gravel. If an Ulcer
          <lb/>succeeds the Stone, the Disease becomes incurable, and the
          <lb/>Patient falis into a Consumption, which soon terminates in
          <lb/>Death. <hi>Areteeus reapi del</hi>. καὶ σημ.χρον. παθ. <hi>Lib</hi>. 2. <hi>Cap</hi>. 3.</p>

        <p rend="indent">Stones in the Kidneys are generated of a thick and Viscid
          <lb/>Mattes, too much bak'd or torrefv'd by the igneous Heat of</p>
        <p>those Parts; so that the material Cause os the Stone is a gross
          <lb/>Matter, but the efficient Cause an igneous Fervency ; for of
          <lb/>fuch Matter, with che Help of Fire, do Potters make their
          <lb/>Vessels, in fuch a manner aS to he indissoluble by Water. This
          <lb/>being the Case, we must endeavour to prevent the Generation
          <lb/>of this gross Matter in the Kidneys, and to preserve those
          <lb/>Parts free from that igneous and intemperate Heat; for, without
          <lb/>either of these, no such thing as a Stone can be generated.
          <lb/>’ You ought to be Very careful in your Examination, whether
          <lb/>a Pain proceeds from the Stone, or not ; for the same Symptoms
          <lb/>happen to those who are afflicted with the Colic, as to
          <lb/>those who labour under the Stone ; and it is no easy Matter,
          <lb/>especially in the Beginning, to distinguish one from the other
          <lb/>by the Signs. In both Affections the Patients are molested with
          <lb/>Vomiting and Costiviness, with Flatulencies and Distentions,
          <lb/>which extend so far as to affect even the Stomach and Liver.
          <lb/>But tho' they have the same Symptoms in common, a Man
          <lb/>who is Master of his Business will know how to distinguish
          <lb/>them ; sor, in the Colic, the Vomitings are more, and the

          <lb/>bound, and the Flatulencies more retain’d : But, in the Stone

          <lb/>a very considerable Difference; sor, in the Colic, it has
          <lb/>a more pitui tous, as well as more copious. Sediment ; but, in
          <lb/>the Stone of the Kidneys, it has less Sediment, and, upon a
          <lb/>careful Examination, you may discover sandy Particles therein,
          <lb/>which are not found in the Urine <hi>of</hi> those affected with the
          <lb/>Colic. The Pain also under a Fit of the Stone is not only
          <lb/>more severe, but fix'd principally in one Place, which does not

        <p rend="indent">The Pain proceeding from the Stone in the Kidneys may be
          <lb/>known by the following Signs: There is a most severe and pun- .
          <lb/>gent Sensation in the Kidney, as if a Thorn were fix'd in it,
          <lb/>which setties in that Part, without shifting, except that sometimes
          <lb/>it communicates itself thro' the Groin towards the Hip,
          <lb/>or the neighbouring Testicle: There is no external Tumor:
          <lb/>The Patient cannot bend his Back without Difficulty: The
          <lb/>Leg on the same Side with the affected Kidney is sometimes
          <lb/>contracted, sometimes, as it were, benumb'd : There are frequent
          <lb/>Eructations, with a great Loathing of Food. When the
          <lb/>Pains are very intense, the Patient is seiz'd with Vomiting;
          <lb/>first of Phlegm, soon aster of yellow Bile, and, at last, of
          <lb/>seruginous Bile ; afterwhich the Pain is mitigated. The Belly,
          <lb/>in this Disorder, is constipated, and, by pressing upon the Kidneywith
          <lb/>the contain'd Faeces or Flatulences, augments the Pain:
          <lb/>But, if it happens to be evacuated, a sort of bilious Matter, together
          <lb/>with Wind, is discharg'd. When the Patient lies on the
          <lb/>affected Part, or while he is fasting, the Pain is mitigated ;
          <lb/>but, when he lies on the contrary Side, or after a full Meal,
          <lb/>when the Food begins to descend towards the Intestines, the
          <lb/>Pains and Disorder are exasperated.</p>
        <p>At the Approach os the Fit, the Urine is little in Quantity,
          <lb/>thin, and aqueous; and soon aster, as the Pain increases, is
          <lb/>frequently utterly suppress'd, till the Stone being discharg'd .
          <lb/>from the urinary Passage, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call οῦρητῆρα, <hi>(Ureter)</hi>
          <lb/>a great Quantity of thick Urine comes off, which deposits a
          <lb/>good deal of Sand, and sometimes large rough Stones, or Fragments
          <lb/>of Stones ; sometimes the Urine appears with Bubbles,
          <lb/>and has an ill Smell ; sometimes comes away frequently, and
          <lb/>in small Quantities, attended with a scalding Heat; oftentimes
          <lb/>it brings away whet is like Blood with it, especially after Labour,
          <lb/>or hard Riding. They who are obnoxious to this Disease, have,
          <lb/>for a long time, discharg'd a thick reddish Urine, with a dense</p>
        <p>and tenacious Spume, which sometimes deposits a red, sandy,
          <lb/>and somewhat Viscous Sediment; sometimes it continues foul,
          <lb/>and, .if strain'd thro'a Woollen Cloth, leaves a Substance like
          <lb/>the Sediment before-mention'd. This kind of Urine often
          <lb/>passes off, for many Years together, without any Inconvenience,
          <lb/>without any Pain in the Kidneys, or any other Symptom
          <lb/>of the Stone ; when, unexpectedly, and all on a sudden, the
          <lb/>Kidney is seiz’d with a most acute Pain, and, at the same time,
          <lb/>the Belly is constipated, and the Leg on the same Side with the
          <lb/>affected Kidney taken with a Numbness. The Pain often remits,
          <lb/>and returns at pretty long Intervals, and sometimes without
          <lb/>discharging any Stone, but a thick and turbid Urine, and,
          <lb/>perhaps, after hard Riding, a bloody one. And, indeed, the
          <lb/>voiding bloody Urine often shews the Stone in the Kidneys,
          <lb/>when there is no Pain, nor any other Mark by which it can be
          <lb/>known, or so much as suspected.<space type="tab"> </space>i</p>
        <p rend="indent">When the Pain is succeeded by an Excretion of the .Stone
          <lb/>from the Kidney, the same, selling into the Head of the <hi>Ureter,</hi>
          <lb/>causes a Discharge os thin waterish Urine, in a finall Quantity ;
          <lb/>or, which often happens, totally suppresses the same. But if
          <lb/>the Stone should happen to be repressed into the Cavity of the </p>

        <p>Kidney, or, at least, if it penetrates into the Bladder, there
          <lb/>follows an Evacuation os fuch Urine-as was hefore describ'd ;</p>
        <p>fo that I am of Opinion, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was in the right, when
          <lb/>he said, that a sudden Pain of the Kidneys, with a Suppression
          <lb/>Of Urine, prognosticated a Discharge os Stones or thick Urine.
          <lb/>The Stone is often so big as not to he expel'd from the Substance
          <lb/>Of the Kidneys, in which it was generated, into their Cavity;
          <lb/>and, during that time, the Patient seek littie or no Pain, but
          <lb/>makes a thick, foul, reddish Water, as above describ'd.
          <lb/>Put after Violent Exercise, or hard Riding, not only such kind
          <lb/>of Urine is discharg'd, but a bloody Urine, winch deposits a
          <lb/>grumous Concretion of a Substance like Blood. When the
          <lb/>Stone is remov'd into the Void Space, or Cavity, of the Kidney,
          <lb/>if it be large, and tend downwards, it stops the Ureter,
          <lb/>and intercepts the Passage of the Urine, in such a manner that
          <lb/>but very little, and such as is of a thin and aqueous Substance,
          <lb/>can be discharg'd; such a Stone, at the same time, excites a
          <lb/>Very sharp Pain. But when the Stone, tho' descended into the
          <lb/>Ureter, is too small to cause a considerable Stoppage of the
          <lb/>Urine, or when large, and newly remov'd from the Substance
          <lb/>into the Cavity <hi>of</hi> the Kidney, and it has not yet applied itself
          <lb/>to the Beginning of the Ureter, there passes off a thick, foal,
          <lb/>red, or a dark, and somewhat livid Urine.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Smooth and round Stones are not so difficult to he discharg'd,
          <lb/>as oblong and rough ones ; but all are not of the same Bigness,
          <lb/>Figure, or Roughness. Persons whe have been long troubled
          <lb/>with Pains in the Kidneys, and have their urinary Passages pretty
          <lb/>oped, are, for that Reason, tormented with large Stones, but
          <lb/>not with those of a moderate Size; whereas those who are but
          <lb/>newly affected with this Disorder, or, at least, have seldom
          <lb/>been pain'd, suffer severely from the least Stone.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Stones of the Kidneys are, almost all of them, os a reddish
          <lb/>Colour, tho' purulent Kidneys discharge also white ones;
          <lb/>black and pale Stones have also been observ’d. In this Affection,
          <lb/>the more aqueous the Urine is, and the longer it so continues,
          <lb/>and the less Sediment it has, the harder, you may assure yourself,
          <lb/>are the Stones in the Kidneys, the more consum'd, and
          <lb/>the more obstinate in resisting Remedies ; tho’ Urine seldom
          <lb/>Comes off clear from these who are subject to great Pains os the
          <lb/>Kidneys. Fat and aged Persons are most frequentiy afflicted
          <lb/>with this Distemper; it seldom or never happens to Children,
          <lb/>and rarely to adult Youth. <hi rend="sup">f</hi> It seldom also molests those who
          <lb/>frequentiy Vomit, and are not subject to be costive. . As all
          <lb/>Disorders in old Persons are Very difficult to be cur'd, so this,
          <lb/>of which we have heen speaking, admits os no Cure at all.
          <lb/>The same is hereditary to a greater Degree than all other Distempers
          <lb/>; so that a Man seldom or never escapes the Torment

        <p rend="indent"><orth>AS</orth> the Pain, rising from a Stone flipping from the Kidneys into
          <lb/>the Ureters, is the most intense and racking that can possibly
          <lb/>afflict Mankind; so, upon its first seizing the Patient, it often
          <lb/>happens, that it is with Difficulty distinguish'd from other acute
          <lb/>Pains of the lumbar Region.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tis a Notion as false and absurd, as 'tis common and popular,
          <lb/>that when any one is seiz'd with Pains about his Loins, he
          <lb/>must therefore be afflicted with the Stone in the Kidneys fince,
          <lb/>in that Region, there are several Parts highly sensible of Pain,
          <lb/>and susceptible of Injury ; such as the external and internal
          <lb/>Muscles of the Loins, the nervous Ligaments of the lumbar
          <lb/>Vertebne, the superior mesenteric Plexus of Nerves, a Branch
          <lb/>of the superior meseraic Artery, and, in their Neighbourhood,
          <lb/>the winding Extremity of the Intestinum Duodenum, and the
          <lb/>Sigmoide Flexure of the Colon; in all which Parts, when either
          <lb/>too much distended, or compressed, by the Stagnation of an
          <lb/>impure bloody, or serouSHumour, very terrible Pains are excited.
          <lb/>Sometimes also a Rheumatism, seizing these Parts, produces
          <lb/>Pains so racking and intolerable, that the miserable Patient, aS

          <lb/>raise himself up. The same Symptom may also be produc'd,
          <lb/>if by a Fall, or lifting any great Burden, the Vertebrae and
          <lb/>Nerves are remov'd ever so littie from their natural and proper
          <lb/>Situation. Too large a Quantity of Blood stagnating about the

        <p>People, in consequence of neglecting Venesection, when they
          <lb/>have been habituated to it, frequentiy excites a Violent Pain in
          <lb/>the Reginn of the Loins, which is commonly, tho' salfly,
          <lb/>ascrib'd to the Stone; fince it is often suddenly remov'd, either
          <lb/>hy Venesection in the Foot alone, or by discutient nitrous
          <lb/>Powders.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But it Very ostenthappens, that the Colic is mistaken for a Pain
          <lb/>produc'd by the Stone; for, when the Flexure os the Colon,
          <lb/>which lies near the Loins, is either too much distended with
          <lb/>Flatulencies, Or spasmodically constricted, a violent Pain is not
          <lb/>Only produc'd in the Region Of the Loins, but also pastes to the
          <lb/>Praecordia, excites a Nausea and Reaching, prevents the Discharge
          <lb/>Of Urine, renders the Patient costive, and racks the
          <lb/>whole Abdomen with Pains as severe as those generally arising
          <lb/>from the Stone. But smce this spasmodic Pain is not constant and
          <lb/>fix'd, but rather wandering, and of such a Nature as to be
          <lb/>greatly reliev'd by the Injection of emollient Clysters, the IkilsuI
          <lb/>Physician may, from these Circumstances, easily distinguish it
          <lb/>from tl.e Pain arising from the Stone, which bears down more
          <lb/>powerfully, does not waste the Strength so much, and remits at
          <lb/>Intervals, so that the Patient can frequently rise, and walk
          <lb/>about, which does not happen in the Colic. Besides, if the
          <lb/>Pain arises from the Stone, the Vomiting and Nausea are
          <lb/>greater when the Stomach is empty than at other times; a Titillation,
          <lb/>and pricking kind of Pain, are also felt in the Urethra
          <lb/>and Glans; the Urine is loaded with Sand, the Testicle is retracted,
          <lb/>the Thigh seiz'd with a Stupor, and the Side itself contracted
          <lb/>; none of winch Symptoms are observ'd to attend the
          <lb/>Colic.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tis to he observ'd, that Stones of a Very large Size, with
          <lb/>considerable Branches rising from them, may be lodg'd in the
          <lb/>Substance of the Kidneys for some Years, without creating any
          <lb/>great Pain or Uneasiness to the Patient; but, as soon as they
          <lb/>are remov'd from their former Seat, and falling into those narrow,
          <lb/>nervous, and muscular Ducts, call'd the Ureters, seek a
          <lb/>Passage thro' them into the Bladder, the most terrible Symptoms
          <lb/>forthwith appear : So that the Ureters themselves may be the
          <lb/>fix’d and genuine Seat of Pains arifing from the Stone; but
          <lb/>these Pains are more or less intense, according as the nervous
          <lb/>Coats of these Canals are more or less distended by the Bulk,” or
          <lb/>irritated by the Roughness, of the Stones winch shall happen to
          <lb/>be lodg'd in them. These Pains are sometimes so severe and intense,
          <lb/>that, besides a Shivering and Refrigeration of the Extremities,
          <lb/>they also excite a Nausea, a Vomiting, a spasmodic
          <lb/>Constriction of the Praecordia, a difficult Discharge of the
          <lb/>Urine, a Stricture of the Belly, an Uneasiness in Breathing, a
          <lb/>Stupor of the Leg, a Retraction os the Testicle to the <hi>0s Pubis,</hi>
          <lb/>Restlesness, incredible Loss of Strength, a Syncope, and even
          <lb/>epileptic Fits; at other times they bring on a Suppression of
          <lb/>Urine, which proves fatal to the Patient. I have sometimes
          <lb/>observ'd Patients complain, that they felt fuch a Pain as if one
          <lb/>was continually inflicting a deep Wound all along the Spine,
          <lb/>near the Bladder; and, in these Cases, when the Patients were
          <lb/>laid open after their Death, the Ureters appear'd distended and
          <lb/>turgid like a Pudding, by the large Quantity of Urine winch
          <lb/>had been deny'd aPaflage into the Bladder, on account ofaStonc
          <lb/>lodged in the Ureter, near its Insertion into that Organ.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tis confirm'd by Observation and Experience, that a Stone
          <lb/>has sometimes been lodg'd for a long time in the Ureter without
          <lb/>creating any great Pain, or intercepting the Passage os the Urine;
          <lb/>asterwhich the Pain has seiz'd the Patient unexpectedly, and
          <lb/>brought along with it Loathing of Fond, Nausea, Vomiting,
          <lb/>and Interception of Urine. This Phenomenon has, in all Probability,
          <lb/>been owing to the Situation of the Stone heing
          <lb/>chang'd by some Accident, fo as, by its Roughness and InequaIity,
          <lb/>to prove more offensive to the nervous Coat of the Ureter.
          <lb/>Nor is this Disorder universally accompanied with the
          <lb/>same Train os Symptoms; for, as <hi>Erasimus</hi> says of the Stone
          <lb/>with which he himself was afflicted, in his Epistle <hi>to Percent
          <lb/>cy or us, “ It</hi> transforms itself into Shapes so unlike those it
          <lb/>" formerly bore, that one would really believe it to be another
          <lb/>" Disorder ; one Set of Symptoms attends its Beginning ;
          <lb/>" another appears in its Progress; it sometimes remains fix'd,
          <lb/>" and sometimes changes its Seat.''</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tis a Circumstance worthy our Attention, that Stones are
          <lb/>more frequentiy lodg'd in the Left, than in the Right Kidney ;
          <lb/>hence it happens, that Pains arising from the Stone in the Kidneys
          <lb/>are observ'd to happen more commonly in the Left than
          <lb/>in the Right Side. This is confirm’d by <hi>Carolus Pise, in Tract,
          <lb/>de Morbis ex serose colluv. oriund</hi>. where he affirms, " that
          <lb/>" among an hundred labouring under the Stone of the Kid-
          <lb/><hi rend="sup">iC</hi> neys, eighty and more have the fatal Cause of their Dis“
          <lb/>order lodg'd in their Left Kidney." Nor is the Reason of
          <lb/>this Phenomenon so much a Mystery as at first it may appear;
          <lb/>for in the Veffeis os the Right Kidney, which is cover’d with
          <lb/>that large Organ the Liver, and cherish'd with a more considerable
          <lb/>Warmth than the Left, the Circulation of the Blood
          <lb/>is quicker, and the Separation of the urinous Serum more
          <lb/>speedily perform'd. Hence a Stagnation of the Blond and
          <lb/>Urine cannot so readfly happen in this as in the Lest Kidney, </p>
        <pb n="136"/>
        <p>which, being encompassed by the Flexure of the Colon, is more
          <lb/>compressed in consequence of a frequent Stagnation of Flatulendes.
          <lb/>Hence it happens, that theintercepted Course of the
          <lb/>Blood thio’ the compressed Vessels renders the Percolation of
          <lb/>the. Utioe thro’ the fmall Tubesmore difficult, brings on a
          <lb/>spcedy Stagnation in them, and consequently leys a Foundation
          <lb/>for the Separation and Concretion of a tartareous or calcareous
          <lb/>Matter. . - j -</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tis equally remarkable, arid equally confirm’d by Experience,
          <lb/>that a Stone which has long remain’d in the Parenchyma

          <lb/>-Age most subjeth to he afflicied with artbritio and; nephritic
          <lb/>Tains. Experience convinces us, thet old Age is of all others
          <lb/>rnost subject to the Stone, both in the-Kidneys, and in the
          <lb/>Bladder; because then the Humours are more inspissated, the
          <lb/>Aliments become acescent in the Stomach, the-Belly is less
          <lb/>open, and Ease, which at that Period of Lise is generally more
          <lb/>indulg’d than in Youth, contributes not a hide to the Generation
          <lb/>of Stones. This Circumstance <hi>Erafmus</hi> in all Probability

        <p rend="indent">It also happens, that scarce any Disorder whatever is so frequently
          <lb/>observ’d to be convey’d from Parents to their Children,
          <lb/>as the Stone and the Gout, another Disorder of a near Affinity
          <lb/>to it in consequence of a peculiar Disposition of the Fluids
          <lb/>and Solids; for both these Calamities not only afflict thofe Men
          <lb/>who are full of Blood, and are said to he of sanguine Habits,
          <lb/>hut they also both draw their Origin from a natural Weakness,
          <lb/>and want of Tone, in the Solids; with this Difference,
          <lb/>thet in the nephritic Patient the Kidneys are the Seat of the
          <lb/>.Weakness; and in the artbritio, the Ligaments of the Joints.
          <lb/>We also frequently observe, that rheumatic and arthritic Disorders
          <lb/>are easily transform^, and converted into chose of the

          <lb/>he very readily becomes afflicted with the Stone in the

        <p rend="indent">As for the Generation of Stones in the Kidneys, we may
          <lb/>account for it in this manner: When, in consequence of too
          <lb/>large an Impulse of .Blond, which with Difficulty returns by
          <lb/>the Veins, the Blond-vessels of the Kidneys are too much
          <lb/>distended and stuff’d; hence it happens, thet the minute
          <lb/>Arteries, where they become small Papillae, .and slender urinary
          <lb/>Ducts, are burst and forc’d open , thus, by a Stagnation
          <lb/>of:the extravasated bloody Serum, stnall.Abscesses and Ulcers
          <lb/>are at first form’d,, and afterwards gradually enlarg’d. When
          <lb/>the urinous Serum, which is impregnated with many tartarous
          <lb/>and flirny Parts, stops in these Abscesses and Ulcers, the more
          <lb/>weighty and acuminated Particles are separated from the rest,
          <lb/>and form themselves into Concretions, which at first, heve the
          <lb/>Appearance of a thick and coarse fabulous Matter ; afterwards
          <lb/>Grains of a closer and more compact Texture are generated,</p>
        <p>which by the Assistance of a plentiful Secretion of Urine are
          <lb/>easily, wash’d away ; and often nor totally discharg’d without
          <lb/>Pain.- Where-ever, then, such agro st and heavy Sand subsides
          <lb/>in the Utioe, it is an infallible Sign of Stones heing lodg’d in
          <lb/>the Kidneys. But -when thofe calculous- Concretions form’d
          <lb/>in the ulcerated/Substance of the Kidneys become gradually
          <lb/>larger and hander, and are, either by the Urine, which - is impregnated
          <lb/>with tartarous Parts, or by some other Caufe; converfd
          <lb/>into the Pelvis, or the Beginnings , of the Ureters, more
          <lb/>terrible Pains are excited, and a formidable Train of Synt?
          <lb/>ptorns appear ; because the calculous Concretions must make
          <lb/>their Way thro’ these narrow Ducts, of. exquisite Sensation,
          <lb/>to the urinary Bladder, into-which when they have, fallen,

          <lb/>with the Utioe; that Patients assiicled with the Stone

          <lb/>heve, aster their Death, been found to be large, flaccid, anil
          <lb/>exulcerated. This is also obvious from a Consideration of the

        <p rend="indent">The Cure of the Stone in the Kidneys, at the time of the
          <lb/>Fit, must he attempted by such Medicines as are of relaxing
          <lb/>and lenitive Qualities, and are, besides, endu’d with the Virtue
          <lb/>of difiolving and expelling the Stone. The theft Remedy sor
          <lb/>these Purposes is Bathing ; because it not only mitigates, but
          <lb/>has Virtue sufficient to cure the Distemper. It frequently indeed
          <lb/>mitigates the Pain of the Colic, without curing it; but,
          <lb/>under a h it of the Stone, it not only mitigates the Pain, but
          <lb/>wholly relieves the Patient. For the inore effectually answering
          <lb/>this End, set the Parts be anointed with Oil of Chamomile
          <lb/>while in the Bath, and let the Patient sit for a good while to:.
          <lb/>nether in the Solium, or Bathing-chain, in plenty .of hot
          <lb/>Water; and not only use the Bath once every Day, but two
          <lb/>or three times, in the Summer Season let him often use the cold
          <lb/>Bath; after which, being well wrapt in Linen, let him drink
          <lb/>the Decoction of Carduus, with Smallage, or a littie Anise.
          <lb/>If the Pain continues, and the Expulsion of the Stone does
          <lb/>not succeed, let him drink the Decoction of Cinquefoil, with
          <lb/>his Cloaths still wrapt about him. This is a very grateful as
          <lb/>well as effectual Medicine, and ought <hi>to</hi> he taken out of the
          <lb/>Bath, either alone, er with Oxymel. If .the Root of Cinquefoil
          <lb/>he wanting, a Decoction Of Eryngo, or Erysimum,
          <lb/>and Prionites, being drank, is very effectual for the feme Purpose.
          <lb/>Outwardly may be apply'd Bags of frumentaceous
          <lb/>Meals, with Decoctions of Chamomile, Marshmallows, MeIilot,
          <lb/>and Oil of Chamomile, often changing them. If
          <lb/>frumentaceous Meals he wanting, you may use Woollen
          <lb/>Rags, moisten’d with sweet Oil, or Oil of Chamomile, often
          <lb/>warming and changing them. Clysters also are to beadministred,
          <lb/>but such as are not very acrimonious, but hevea good
          <lb/>Quantity of Oil in them, and are endu'd with a laxative and
          <lb/>dissolvent Virtue. Such are Decoctions os Marshmallows,
          <lb/>Fenugreek, dry'd Figs, Chamomile, and Oil Of Chamomile;
          <lb/>and in Constitutions where Heat much abounds. Cremor os

          <lb/>Thefe Medicines being of a lenitive Quality, by restoring the

          <lb/>and prevent those who have always the Stone in the Kidneys
          <lb/>froth having a Fit. If the Disease be still obstinate, we must

        <p rend="indent">The whole Secret in curing Nepbritic Pains seems to consist
          <lb/>in bringing away the Stones easily, and with aS littie Trouble as
          <lb/>possible; and in preventing and hindering the fresh Formation
          <lb/>of that Sand or Matter which proves the immediate Cause of
          <lb/>the Disorder, and .all its concomitant Symptoms ; for the Method
          <lb/>of Cure, under an actual Paroxysm, differs widely from
          <lb/>the Measures to be taken when the Patient is in a State of perfect
          <lb/>Ease ; in which Case, Preservation or Prevention ought to
          <lb/>be the intention of the Physician.</p>
        <p rend="indent">In the Paroxysm itself, where the Symptoms are Violent,
          <lb/>and the whole CEconomy of the Vital Functions disorder'd by
          <lb/>the exquisite and intolerable Pain, the first Step to be taken is,
          <lb/>by proper Medicines, to allay the Vehemence os the Pain; and,
          <lb/>by well-chosen Remedies, to sooth, and, if possible, remove
          <lb/>the spasmodic Strictures, winch not only rack the adjacent Parts,
          <lb/>but, in consequence of that mutual Consent which prevails hetween
          <lb/>any one Part and all the others, the whole nervous
          <lb/>System. This is so much the more necessary, because, under
          <lb/>such a Violent Attack os Spasms, which constrict and brace up
          <lb/>the Urinary Ducts, the Progress Of the Stone thro' the Ureter </p>
        <pb n="138"/>
        <p rend="indent">into the Bladder is, with the greatest Difficulty, promoted.
          <lb/>Among the rnost celebrated Medicines for answering this intention,
          <lb/>I must, above all others, recommend my own anodyne
          <lb/>Mineral Liquor, on account of its Efficacy and Safeness ;
          <lb/>sor, when exhibited in small, but frequent Doses, by allaying
          <lb/>the Spasms of the <hi>Prima Vior</hi>, it wonderfully removes the uneasy
          <lb/>Sensation there seis, the Nausea, and the Vomiting. ' If a
          <lb/>sufficient Quantity of this Medicine <hi rend="u">cann</hi>ot be had, the. most
          <lb/>proper Succedaneum to it is Spirit of Nitre, carefully prepared,
          <lb/>in the manner directed. by me in <hi>Ohs.ervat. Physico-chym</hi>. See
          <lb/>NITRUM. For this Spirit, being now divested of its acid QuaTty,
          <lb/>by its mild and sulphureous Exhalations dispels Flatulencies,
          <lb/>and relaxes spasmodic Strictures. The Spirit is, for this
          <lb/>Intention, most properly exhibited with sedative Waters; such
          <lb/>as that of black Cherries, and those of the Flowers os <hi>Egyptian</hi>
          <lb/>Thorn, Elder, red Poppies, Lime-tree, Primrose, Lily os the
          <lb/>Valley, Meadow-sweet, and especially the Waters of Chamomile-flowers,
          <lb/>and-the Tops of Yarrow, with the Addition of a
          <lb/>little of the bynip of red-or white Poppies. It may also he
          <lb/>exhibited in Flesh-broth, with a-sew Spoonfuls of pure and
          <lb/>new Oil of Almonds, obtain'd without Fire. This intention
          <lb/>is also answered by Emulsions of sweet Almonds, the Four cold
          <lb/>heeds, and those of Poppy, Gromwel, and Carrot-seeds, prepared
          <lb/>with she above-mention’d Waters,. and edulcorated with
          <lb/>a sufficient Quantity of the <hi>Syrupus Albus</hi>. But when' these
          <lb/>mild and gentie Medicines are not sufficient for mitigating the
          <lb/>Pain, we must have recourse to those which are somewhat more
          <lb/>powerful, such as Opiates, corrected, and render'd safe, by the
          <lb/>Addition of other Substances; of this Kind are the Pilulae.Wildegansii,
          <lb/>the Pilulae Starkii, <hi>Sydenhdnrs</hi> Liquid Laudanum, the
          <lb/>Theriaca Coelestis, and the Trochisci de AIkekengi; all which,
          <lb/>on account of their Efficacy, and the Tendency of them Ingredients
          <lb/>to sooth and allay Pain, deserve the highest Encoiniums.

        <p rend="indent">Besides these Remedies already mention'd, nitrons Preparations,
          <lb/>and among these Nitre alone, purified and crystallized,
          <lb/>or an artificial Composition of the Spirit of Nitre, and Salt of

          <lb/>acutePains, accompanied with Violent and raging Commotions
          <lb/>of-the Blood and Humours; and must, of consequence, be of
          <lb/>all others the most proper in Nephritic Disorders. ' These Pre-</p>

          <lb/>intolerable, internal Medicines alone are not sufficient for soothing
          <lb/>and allaying them ; but external Applications must also be
          <lb/>called in to the Relief of the Patient.; and, among these, noneproduce
          <lb/>more happy and salutary Effects than Clysters prepared
          <lb/>of emollient Flowers, especially those of -the Garden Mallows,
          <lb/>Elder, red Poppies, Yarrow, common Chamomile, and MulIen,

          <lb/>Flatulencies cannot be transmitted, but, rising to the superior
          <lb/>Parts, increase the Uneasiness they already labour under, I have,
          <lb/>in this Case, often observed Very singular Relief afforded by
          <lb/>Clysters of Oil, and pinguious Substances. The Belly being
          <lb/>thus rendered soluble, and a Passage open'd for the Flatulencies,

        <p rend="indent">As, in the Beginning of this Disease, Preservation is, comparatively
          <lb/>speaking, an easy Tash ;: so in Its Progress, when, in
          <lb/>consequence of any considerable Fault or Exulceration of the
          <lb/>Kidneys, a large Quantity of Stones is form'd, and the Paroxysms
          <lb/>return frequentiy, the Disorder is attended with the greatest
          <lb/>Difficulty of Cute, and a Set of the most perplexing
          <lb/>CirctinistanoeS; for since; aS I heve already observed, many
          <lb/>are afflicted with Nephritic Pains, either in consequence of a
          <lb/>preternaturally large Quantity of Bloed, or from its being render'd
          <lb/>crude and thick, by the Ufe of a Variety of incongruous.

          <lb/>diluting Liquors, especially the medicinal <hi>Sell or cm</hi> Waters, as

          <lb/>Necessity for having recourse to Medicines os a Vulnerary, gently
          <lb/>consolidating, and -astringent Quality ; for which Reason <hi>it</hi>
          <lb/>has long ago been observed by many, and confirmed by the
          <lb/>Practice of the common People, that, by a long Use of Decoctions,
          <lb/>or Infusions of Vuinerary Herbs, prepared with Water
          <lb/>or Ale, and mix'd with sweet Butter or Honey, many have
          <lb/>heen entirely freed from this Disorder. The principal Herbs
          <lb/>proper sor this Purpose are Horsetail, Golden-rod, Groundivy,
          <lb/>Strawberries, white Horehound, Paul's-betony, Pellitory
          <lb/>of the Wall, Yarrow with its Tops, Mallows, Baric
          <lb/>of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Thorn-root, Club-moss, torrefiedJuniper-berries,
          <lb/>Strawberries dried, the Stones and Fruit of roasted Hips; of
          <lb/>which Powders an electuary may be prepared, with white'
          <lb/><hi>Prussian</hi> Honey, which, by its consolidating and balsamic Quality,
          <lb/>is Very proper against Disorders of the Kidneys; and
          <lb/>half a Spoonful of it, taken in the Morning, drinking Tea after
          <lb/>it, has been observed to afford Very fingular Relief to those
          <lb/>who, for many Years, heve laboured under these Disorders. -</p>
        <p rend="indent">There is also another Method of preserving from the Stone
          <lb/>by alcaline Medicines, which subdue and destroy that acid and
          <lb/>glutinous Matter, which is the principal Foundation and
          <lb/>Ground-work of the calculous Concretions : Hence it is, that

          <lb/>Nitre, Tinctures of Tartar, and the acrid Tincture of Antimony,
          <lb/>frequently used, prevent the Generation of Stones, and
          <lb/>consequentiy free the Patient from the Violent Pains produced
          <lb/>- by them.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There are still more Remedies, whose Efficacy is observed to
          <lb/>be equally heneficial to Nephritic Patients; and these are such
          <lb/>as, consisting of oleous, pinguious, mild, and somewhat, anoe-dyne
          <lb/>Particles, prevent that Union of the saline Spicuhe, winch
          <lb/>is necessary to the Formation of a solid Concretion; for it is
          <lb/>known, from Chymical Experiments, how small a Quantity of
          <lb/>any pinguious Substance retards Crystallization. To this Class
          <lb/>we may also justly refer those Seeds and Fruits which abound
          <lb/>with a mild and sweet Oil; such as the Four greater cold Seeds,
          <lb/>thofe of Gromwel, Saxifrage, white Poppy, and Ladies-thistle,
          <lb/>sweet and bitter Almonds, Stones of Cherries and Peaches,
          <lb/>which, either when reduced to a Powder with Sugar, or made
          <lb/>up in the Form of an Emulsion, and frequently used, prove of
          <lb/>fingular Service to those who are frequentiy afflicted with this
          <lb/>Disorder. We may also reckon, among the best Remedies for
          <lb/>Distempers of the Kidneys, Liquorice-root, the Powder or Infusion
          <lb/>of which is os fingular Efficacy, in obtunding and correcting
          <lb/>the acrid Particles of the Salts, and washing off mucous
          <lb/>Substances. Among other Valuable Medicines of this Class we
          <lb/>may also justly reckon Yarrow, with its Tops ; an Infusion or
          <lb/>Decoction of which is, in Disorders of this Kind, of the most
          <lb/>fingular and surprifing Efficacy, if used' daily for a considerable
          <lb/>time. By the Use of this single Herb, I have observed some
          <lb/>Patients entirely sreed srom Nephritic Pains, to which they had
          <lb/>been long subject ; for it is proper in Cafes of this Nature, upon
          <lb/>several Accounts, fince, besides its consolidating and mitigating
          <lb/>Quality, it abounds with a truly anodyne Oil, winch, both in
          <lb/>Colour and Virtues, resembles that of Chamomile, and is high*

        <p rend="indent">But as in the Cure, as well as the Prevention, of this Disorder,
          <lb/>the chief Business of the Physician consists in adjusting his
          <lb/>- Medicines to different Constitutions, Ages, and Temperaments,
          <lb/>and accommodating them to the particular Functions injured,
          <lb/>and the several concurring Causes of the Disorder, I shall subjoin
          <lb/>Tome Cautions and Observations, which will be found to
          <lb/>he not only useful, but necessary in Practice. First of all, then,
          <lb/>we are diligentiy and carefully to consider, that the Medicines
          <lb/>used in the Cure of this Disorder are not equally fit and proper
          <lb/>for all Constitutions; nor do they always produce the same
          <lb/>Effect, or afford the same Relief, on account of the different
          <lb/>and mutable State of the Fluids, and the peculiar Texture of
          <lb/>she Solids depending upon that Difference, winch is, by the
          <lb/><hi>Greeks</hi>, call'd <hi>Idiofyncrasia</hi>. For this Reason Medicines
          <lb/>should sometimes be Varied; fince, in Process of Time, Nature
          <lb/>becomes so habituated to one Medicine, that it often ceases to
          <lb/>produce the same Effect it formerly did.</p>

          <lb/>some Cases, Medicines are of no manner of Efficacy, till Nature
          <lb/>herself come in to their Assistance : Hence it sometimes
          <lb/>happens, that Quacks, with then insignificant Medicines, have
          <lb/>acquired the Reputation of performing a Cure which was
          <lb/>wrought by Nature herself. The Physician ought therefore to
          <lb/>advert to this, that Nature alone often, puts a Period to these
          <lb/>violent Spasms, Pains, and Commotions; winch is not to be

          <lb/>lucky Moment in which Nature begins to act, and exert her
          <lb/>Force for the Relief of the Patient. Hence it is sometimes adviseable,
          <lb/>eipecially when Medicines have for some time been
          <lb/>exhibited without Success, to desist from their Use, that Nature
          <lb/>may be allow'd to take her own Measures, since she often

          <lb/>with a preservative Intention, they produce happy Effects, not

        <p rend="indent">In order to the Cure of a Stone in the Kidneys, the Physician’s

          <lb/>its Expulsion; or, at least, to bring it into a Part, where it
          <lb/>may reside, without giving exquisite Pain, aS into the Bladder.
          <lb/>. This is principally done by a moist, mild, thin, and moderately
          <lb/>salt Diet ; by drinking Liquors of an aqueous Nature, or

          <lb/>are seldom or never found. And hence he .draws an Argument

          <lb/>though very seldom, in the Right.' And after the Gout went
          <lb/>off, , the Pain in the Kidneys remain'd, and attack'd me at InterYaissiwhich,
          <lb/>though'it was not Vesp sharp, made me fear the
          <lb/>Stone ; for I had hitherto escap'd those Fits which are attended
          <lb/>with-severe Pain along the Ureters, and-Violent Vomiting.- But
          <lb/>though ~ these Signs' of the Stone in’ the Kid ney appear'd ’ not
          <lb/>hitherto, yet.I had Reason to believe Ithada largo Stone in one
          <lb/>of them, winch, being too big to pass into the Ureters,' occasioned,
          <lb/>he above-mentioned Symptoms? ” And several Years
          <lb/>afterwards I found I was not mistaken sorhaving walk'd constderably,
          <lb/>and for a long time, in the Winter Season; in I676.
          <lb/>soon after the breaking of a severe Frost, 1 made a bloody’ Urine
          <lb/>directly, and constantly did fo whenever I walk'd much, or was
          <lb/>carried in a Coach over the Stones, though the Horses, went

        <p rend="indent">The Urine I voided on these Occasions, though it look’d
          <lb/>very.bad at the time of making, so aS to resemble Blood, yet
          <lb/>soon after it became clear at the Top, like natural Urine, tht
          <lb/>Bleed falling to the Bottom by itself in Clots. To relieve the
          <lb/>Diforder. I had a larsse Quantity os Blood taken from my Arm i </p>
        <pb n="141"/>
        <p>and, after taking some Purges, had recourse to several Sorts of
          <lb/>cooling, incrassati ng Remedies, along with a proper Regimen,
          <lb/>and carefully forbore all sharp, pungent, and attenuating Liquors.
          <lb/>But having received no Benefit from these, and many
          <lb/>other Remedies, which it would take up too much Time to
          <lb/>enumerate, and searing to drive the Stone forwards by Steelwaters,
          <lb/>as suspecting it was too large to he expel'd thereby, I
          <lb/>at length lost .ail Hopes of relieving myself by this Way, especially
          <lb/>having found, that some ofmy Acquaintance hastened their
          <lb/>Death by fruitiefly endeavouring to cure this Complaint by fuch
          <lb/>Medicines ; for which Reason i resolved to desist from all sarther
          <lb/>Trials, unless by way of Prevention, by avoiding all Motion
          <lb/>of the Body aS much as I could.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But happening afterwards to recollect the great Commendations
          <lb/>which some Persons have hestow'd on the Seed of the Ashtree,
          <lb/>for its Stone-dissolving or Stone-breaking Virtue, I imagined,
          <lb/>that if the Seed had so much Virtue, .the Manna
          <lb/>thereof might probably have more. For the Manna which
          <lb/>comes to us, according to Mr. <hi>Ray</hi>, and other earlier Writers,
          <lb/>is neither an aereal Honey, nor a certain heavenly Dew, but
          <lb/>rather a Liquor ousing from tite Leaves, Branches, or Trunk
          <lb/>of the <hi>Calabrian</hi> Ash-tree ; of the Truth of which Mr. <hi>Ray</hi>
          <lb/>was farther satisfied, whilst he was on his Travels to <hi>Italy</hi>, by a
          <lb/>Physician, who frequentiy gathered Manna from the Branches
          <lb/>and Leaves of these Trees, first closely covered with Linen.
          <lb/>Accordingly, to make the Trial, I dissolved two Ounces and
          <lb/>an half of Manna in a Quart os Whey, and drank it; and
          <lb/>took a littie Lemon-juice between whiles, as. well to make it
          <lb/>operate more speedily, it being ordinarily a stout Purgative, as
          <lb/>to render it more agreeable to the Stomach. It is hard to express
          <lb/>the Ease I perceived in the Region of the Kidneys, from
          <lb/>this Medicine; sor though the Pain was not continual before,.
          <lb/>yet I felt a troublesome Weight. Encourag'd by this Success,
          <lb/>I took this Purgative every Week, on a set Day, for some
          <lb/>Months, and found a manifest Amendment after every Purge,
          <lb/>till at length I could hear more shaking in a Coach ; and indeed
          <lb/>continued free from this Symptom till last Spring, at the Beginning
          <lb/>of which it return’d, occasioned by my having had .the
          <lb/>Gout severely all the preceding Winter, and my Inability to
          <lb/>Motion, whence I was constrained to abate <hi>os my ordinary
          <lb/>Exercise. And now I</hi> doubted whether I should have recourse
          <lb/>to Purging again, as finding that the mildest Purge certainly
          <lb/>occasioned a Fit os the Gout, because the whole Substance of
          <lb/>my Body, in these latter Years, had, in a manner, .degenerated
          <lb/>Into Nourishment for this Distemper. But at length I recollected,
          <lb/>that I might safely resume my former Method of taking
          <lb/>Manna once a Week, provided I took an Opiate in the Evening,
          <lb/>after the Operation, to quiet the Tumult raised by the
          <lb/>Purgative. Accordingly, in the Morning,st drank two Ounces
          <lb/>and an half of Manna distblved in a Quart of Whey ; and at
          <lb/>Night took sixteen Drops of liquid Laudanum in Small-beer ;
          <lb/>and repeated the Manna and Laudanum in this manner twice, a
          <lb/>Week, for three Weeks. But afterwards I took the Manna
          <lb/>only once a Week, hecause it discharged such Plenty of soul
          <lb/>Humours, aS to leave littie Fear of the Gout. And Reason intimating,
          <lb/>that if Manna was possessed of any Stone-dissolving
          <lb/>or Stone-breaking Virtue, its efficacy, on which I depended,
          <lb/>must needs be lessened, in some measure, by so powerful an
          <lb/>Astringent aS Laudanum is, I thought it best to omit taking the
          <lb/>Opiate, aS I only purged once a Week.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I have continued this Method for some Months, always
          <lb/>purging on the same Day of the Week, and would not upon
          <lb/>any Account be persuaded to break it.. Put though the Pain of
          <lb/>my Back abated aS formerly, upon taking the first Purges.. yet
          <lb/>soon after repeated Purging brought on some Symptoms os the
          <lb/>Gout, and sometimes affected the Limbs, and sometimes the
          <lb/>-Bowels; but Laudanum effectually check'd these Motions os
          <lb/>the. Distemper. This Method, however, having hitherto been
          <lb/>successful, I judg’d it proper to confinue.it, both to prevent
          <lb/>the Return os the bloody Urine, and th carry off a Part ofthe
          <lb/>Matter which forms the Stone. And, in the End, it answered
          <lb/>my Expectation, having never had this Symptom since my first
          <lb/>Publication of this Treatise, and therefore I left off the Manna
          <lb/>entirely../. .. 'I . .</p>
        <p>With respect to Purging, therefore, in case Of bloody Urine,
          <lb/>and provided only Manna be used according to the Method
          <lb/>above delivered, I must retract an Assertion I formerly publish'd
          <lb/>in my Treatise on the Gout, which is, that it is absolutely
          <lb/>improper to purge gouty Persons, either at the Beginning, Declension;
          <lb/>or in the Intervals of the Fits. For I did not then
          <lb/>recollect, that the Fit, which I fear'd might he occasioned by
          <lb/>the Purgative, might be prevented by giving an Opiate at
          <lb/>Night. Nevertheless, if the Gout only he attended to, all
          <lb/>manner of Evacuations are very pernicious therein, and therefore
          <lb/>not to he used; unless the above-mentioned Symptom
          <lb/>requires them.</p>
        <p rend="indent">To these Observations I will add a few Particulars relating to
          <lb/>the Regimen and Diet, which should seem proper in heth these
          <lb/>Distempers ; sor I would not omit mentioning any thing that
          <lb/>may he serviceable to Persons in my Condition. In the Morn-</p>
        <p>ing, after I rise, I drink a Dish or two of Tea ; then I go out
          <lb/>in my Coach till Noon ; and, at my Return home, dine moderately
          <lb/>upon any kind of Meat I like, that is easy os Digestion j
          <lb/>for Moderation is principally necessary. I drink a littie morie
          <lb/>than a Quarter of a Pint of Canary immediately after Dinner
          <lb/>every Day, to promote Digestion, and drive the Gout from
          <lb/>my Bowels. In the Afternoon I go out again in mv Coach,
          <lb/>and, when Business permits, take a Turn into the Country,
          <lb/>two or three Miles, for good Air. A Draught of finall Beer
          <lb/>serves me instead of a Supper; and I drink another Draught
          <lb/>aster I am in Bed, and about to compose myself to Sleep, inorder
          <lb/>to dilute and cool the het and acrid Humours lodg’d in
          <lb/>the Kidneys, which breed the Stone. I always prefer small
          <lb/>Beer brew'd with Hops, to that which has none ; hecause, the'
          <lb/>unhopp'd small Beer is smoother and softer, and so better suited
          <lb/>to bring away the Stone from the Kidneys, yet that which is
          <lb/>brew'd with Hops, on account of the Stypticity it receives from
          <lb/>the Hops, . is less subject to breed Gravel and calculous Matter,
          <lb/>than that which has none, aS being more viscid and flimy. Ou
          <lb/>my purging Day I dine upon a Chicken, and, notwithstanding,
          <lb/>drink my Canary as usual. I go to Bed early, especially in the
          <lb/>Winter Season ; this heing one of the best Helps for promoting
          <lb/>Digestion, and preserving the proper Order of Nature; whereas,
          <lb/>on the contrary, sitting up late weakens all the digestive Faculties
          <lb/>in aged Persons afflicted with any Chronic Disease, and injures
          <lb/>their Vital Principle to a Degree not to he easily remedy 'th
          <lb/>And, to prevent bloody Urine from the Stone, whenever! am
          <lb/>oblig’d to go very sar in iny Coach upon the Stones, (for the
          <lb/>longest Journey in. unpav'd Roads does me not the. least Hurt)
          <lb/>I always drink a large Draught of small Beer hesore I set out, *
          <lb/>and another in the Way, if I am abroad a considerable time; by
          <lb/>which means! secure myself pretty well from bloody Urine.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Lastly, we are to take Notice of the great Danger winch
          <lb/>some Persons, who have the Gout and Stone, run, by unadvisedly
          <lb/>taking Manna diflolv'd in the purging Mineral Waters ;
          <lb/>for, tho', being taken this, way, it works quicker, and sits easier
          <lb/>on the Stomach, yet these inconsiderable. Advantages are no
          <lb/>Equivalent, for the Mischief otherwise occasion'd by the Waters.
          <lb/>For if the Stone in the Kidneys he too large to he forc'd thro'
          <lb/>the Ureters into the.Bladder, these Waters generally occasion a
          <lb/>Fit, which continues, not without endangering the Life of the
          <lb/>Patient, till’ the Stone gets back again into the Pelvis. Steal
          <lb/>Waters likewise are unsafe, unless it be certainly known hesorehand,
          <lb/>that the Stone is small enough either to flip, or force its
          <lb/>Way, tbro'the Ureters; winch, to the best of my Judgment,
          <lb/>can only he: learn'd with Certainty from hence; <hi>viz. if</hi> the Patient
          <lb/>hath already had a Fit of the Stone, (winch consists, ina
          <lb/>Very sharp Pain in one of the Kinneys, extending thro'.the*
          <lb/>whole Duct of the Ureters, and accompany'^ with Violent
          <lb/>Vomiting) he may he allur'd, that the Pelvis,, instead os having
          <lb/>a large Stone in it, rather contains aNumher of small Stones,
          <lb/>one of: which will fall occasionally into the Ureters, and cause
          <lb/>a Fit, which generally lasts till it is forc'd into the Bladder. . In
          <lb/>this Case, I shy, there istho better Remedy, either to prevent
          <lb/>the increase os small Stones; or to expel them from the Kinneys,
          <lb/>tharudrinking Steel-waters plentifully every Summer, .</p>
        <p rend="indent">But, aS Persons may often he seiz'd with a Fit of the Stone,
          <lb/>when these Waters are either not procurable, or at an improper
          <lb/>Season sor drinking them,, they .are .to he .treated according to<hi rend="sup">X</hi>
          <lb/>the following short Method. : The Patient being sanguine, , and
          <lb/>not aged, take ten Ounces of Blood away from the Arm of
          <lb/>the pain'd Side; then let a Gallon of Posset-drink, in which
          <lb/>two Ounces of the Roots of Marshmallows have been boil'd,
          <lb/>he drank with.the utmost Expedition, and the following Clyster
          <lb/>injected, <hi>s<space type="tab"> </space>'<space type="tab"> </space></hi>-.'1 . ... ι .st .0 :</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Take of the Roots os Marshmallows, and the.whiteDily,
          <lb/>each an Ounce; the Leaves of Mallows, Pellitory os the
          <lb/>Wall, Bearfs-breech, and Chamomile-flowers, .each, an
          <lb/>Handful ; the Seeds of Flax and Fenugreek, each half an
          <lb/>Ounce: Boil'them together in a sufficient Quantity of
          <lb/>Water to a Pint and a half; in the strain'd Liquor diflolve
          <lb/>brown Sugar, and: Syrup of Marshmallows, each two
          <lb/>Ounces: Mix the .Whole for a Clyster. ,</p>
        <p rend="indent">When: thoPatient has thrown up the Posset'-drink, and the
          <lb/>Clyster has done working, give a sufficient large Dose os liquid
          <lb/>Laudanum, for Instance, twenty-five Drops, or fifteen or sixteen
          <lb/>Grains os <hi>Matthew's</hi> Pill. But Bleeding isnot to be us'd
          <lb/>imaged Persons, worn out by shine inveterate chronic Disease,
          <lb/>and antient Women, subject to the Vapours, especially if they
          <lb/>void black gravelly Urine at the Beginning os the Fit. Nevertheless,
          <lb/>in other respects, this Method must be closely follow'd.</p>
        <p rend="indent">But, to return to the Stone, supposing it a large one, which
          <lb/>is our present Subject: If the Patient hath never had a Fit, on
          <lb/>account of the Stone'S being too large to quit the Pelvis, Steelwaters
          <lb/>will not only do no Service, but cannot be us'd without
          <lb/>immediate Danger, for the Reasons aheve-mention'd. Nor do
          <lb/>Mineral Waters succeed better in gouty Persons, if they he ad- *

        <p><hi>From</hi> ARETAEUs,</p>
        <p>No Disease affecting the Bladder is of a gentie Nature;
          <lb/>for, as to acute Disorders of that Part, such as Inflammations,
          <lb/>Wounds, Convulsions, and acute Fevers, they are all mortal;
          <lb/>and an Ulcer, an Abscess, the Palsy, or a large Stone in the
          <lb/>fame, are incurable. The Stone is not to be dissolv'd by any
          <lb/>Potion, or lithontriptic Medicine, nor taken out by cutting,
          <lb/>with any Safety; for the fine Membranes of the Bladder must,
          <lb/>at the same time, he cut, which Operation kills the Patient on
          <lb/>the same Day, or carries him off in a few Days with Convulsions
          <lb/>and a Fever. If the Stone be not cut out, an Ischury,
          <lb/>Pain, Fever, and Colliquations, destroy the Patient ; or, is it
          <lb/>he of no considerable Bigness, the Suppression of Urine is the
          <lb/>more obstinate, because it the more easily salis into the Neck of
          <lb/>the Bladder, and intercepts the Passage of the Urine; and tho'
          <lb/>such a Stone may be extracted with less Danger than a larger,
          <lb/>it is necessary to cut the Bladder, the Consequence of which,
          <lb/>if not Death, is a continual Efflux of the Urine, which, tho'
          <lb/>no dangerous Disorder, is yet insupportable to in free Person,
          <lb/>who knows not how to live under a perpetual Dribbling, winch
          <lb/>molests him whether he fleeps or wakes, and is Very troublesome
          <lb/>in walking; but a Multitude of small Stones may be cut out
          <lb/>with Safety.</p>
        <p rend="indent">If a Stone grows to the Bladder, it manifesta itself by the
          <lb/>Uneasiness, and sometimes Pain, which it excites, and a Weight
          <lb/>which is felt, tho' not accompany'd with a Dysury ; but if it
          <lb/>does not adhere to the Bladder, there is also a Dysury. All
          <lb/>Stones may he known by the sandy Sediment in the Urine; the
          <lb/>Pudenda also project. The Patients Void their Urine with Pain,
          <lb/>hyreason of the Obstruction from the Stone, and handle and attract
          <lb/>the Pudendum, as if they would pull out the Stone and
          <lb/>the Bladder together; the Anus suffers by Consent, being affected
          <lb/>with an Itching. The Intestinum Rectum is protruded
          <lb/>by the Violent Efforts of the Patient, who imagines himself on
          <lb/>the point of Voiding the Stone; sor there is so near a Vicinity
          <lb/>- hetween the Bladder and the Anus, that they mutually affect
          <lb/>each other; wherefore, in an Inflammation of the Anus, the
          <lb/>Bladder labours under a Suppression os Urine; and, in Diseases
          <lb/>of the Bladder, the Anus will discharge nothing, tho'the Belly

        <p rend="indent">The Stone in the Bladder afflicts the Patient by Fits at certain
          <lb/>Times, aster the same manner as the Stone in the Kidneys ;
          <lb/>hut the former is more frequent in Children than adult Persons,
          <lb/>and does not owe its Rise to so great a Heat, but rather to a
          <lb/>grosser Matter, proper for the Generation of Stones, which
          <lb/>readily forms Concretions, by means of the natural Heat. Our
          <lb/>main intention, therefore, must be to correct the Grosthessof
          <lb/>this Matter by Attenuants, and to prevent any considerable

        <pb n="143"/>

          <lb/>calls upon the Physician to use his best Endeavours to expel the
          <lb/>Stone. There are Various Parts of the Urethra in which the
          <lb/>Stone may be seated : Sometimes it lies in the Beginning of the
          <lb/>Urethra, behind the Scrotum, about the Perinaeum, in the
          <lb/>Neck or Sphincter os the Bladder ; sometimes about the Middle
          <lb/>of the urinary Duct, before the Scrotum, and sometimes not
          <lb/>sar from the End of the Urethra. Sometimes the Stone is
          <lb/>lodg'd in a peculiar Expansion, or Bag of the Urethra; such a
          <lb/>one is describ’d by <hi>Le Dr an, Obs. Chir</hi>. 79. <hi>Tom</hi>. 2. and

          <lb/>I myself, this present Year 1737. discover'd Stones in such a
          <lb/>Bag before the Scrotum ; and, whet is seldom known, cut
          <lb/>two out of one little Bag under the Urethra, which are represented

          <lb/>is detain’d, may be judg'd partly from the Pain, and partiy from
          <lb/>Searches made with the Fingers or Instruments. The Cure may
          <lb/>he attempted various Ways: Sometimes internal Medicines,
          <lb/>which provoke Urine, and, at the same time, external ones,'
          <lb/>aS Fomentations, Cataplasms, Bathing, Clysters, and the like,
          <lb/>are administer’d, and continu'd for some time. If all these
          <lb/>prove ineffectual, the next Attempt is to moisten and lubricate
          <lb/>the inside of the Urethra by injections of Oil of Olives, or
          <lb/>Oil of sweet Almonds, that the Passage being render'd ilippery,
          <lb/>the Stone may the more easily Aide off; or the Patient is put
          <lb/>into some emollient Bath, with the same View. Some bind
          <lb/>the Penis behind the Stone, and then distend the Forepart of
          <lb/>the Urethra by strong Inflation, in order to enlarge the passage
          <lb/>for the more easy Expulsion of the Stone. This Method of
          <lb/>Cure is practised by the <hi>Egyptians</hi>, as we are assured, among
          <lb/>other Authors, by <hi>Profpcr Alpinus</hi> in his <hi>Medicina AEgyptiorum,

        <p rend="indent">If the Stone cannot he expel'd by these Remedies, but the
          <lb/>Difficulty of Urine is rather exasperated by them, it" will be
          <lb/>conVenient to try some other powerful Remedy. First, then,
          <lb/>if the Stone be detain'd in the Neck os the Bladder, it may be
          <lb/>cut out by making a Section in the Perinaeum, where it is perceiv’d
          <lb/>by the Touch ; but, because many are Very much afraid
          <lb/>of an Instrument which carries an Edge, the Stone may be
          <lb/>push'd hack into the Bladder by introducing the Catheter.
          <lb/>However, since it is to he fear'd, that the Stone will increase in
          <lb/>the Bladder, and, by that means, expose the Patient to far
          <lb/>greater Danger, I should prefer Section- So, also, if the Stone
          <lb/>should happen to stick too fast in this Place to he repel'd by the
          <lb/>Catheter, and so reduce the Patient to Extremities, or if we do
          <lb/>not think it advifeable to repress it for the Reason aforesaid, it
          <lb/>must be artfully extracted by the Section call’d the <hi>Apparatus
          <lb/>minor</hi>, or <hi>lesser Apparatus</hi>, one or two Fingers heing introduc'd
          <lb/>into the Anus, in order to sustain the Stone ; for oftentimes
          <lb/>there is no other Way to save the Patient's Life. If the Stone
          <lb/>he detain'd near the Glans, the best Method, aster using the
          <lb/>Remedies above proposed, is, first to lubricate and relax the
          <lb/>narrow Passage, by repeated Injections of Oil into the Urethra,
          <lb/>and then, with the Fingers, to press the Stone forwards, or attempt
          <lb/>its Extraction, especially in Boys, by Suction with the
          <lb/>Mouth of some Woman, Nurse, or Assistant; for, by this
          <lb/>means, all Wounds, Cicatrices, and Fistulas of the Urethra,
          <lb/>are happily prevented. If the Stone sticks near the End os the
          <lb/>Passage, it is to be taken with the Forceps, Hook, ter some
          <lb/>sort of Ear-probe, (see <hi>Tala frig</hi>. 14.) and gently drawn
          <lb/>forth. If this be impracticable, it will not he amiss to try the
          <lb/>Instrument so much recommended by <hi>Marini</hi>, and describ'd by
          <lb/>him (see <hi>Tab. 5O. Pig</hi>. 7.). Os thia Instrument, the Part (A)
          <lb/>is cautioufly introduc'd into the Urethra, heyond the Stone, of
          <lb/>which it takes hold ; then the Operator takes the Part (B) in
          <lb/>his Hand, and gently pulling, draws along the Stone,, and extracts
          <lb/>it. But if either an Inflammation, or the Bulk os the
          <lb/>Stone, should, contrary to Expectation, render all these Methods
          <lb/>ineffectual, we are directed by <hi>Tulpius andUarengeot to</hi>
          <lb/>make use of Section. And <hi>Garengeot, in</hi> such a Case, immediately
          <lb/>cuts the Extremity of the Glans with the .Scissars, and
          <lb/>then introducing a Probe, or Hook, into theWound, extracts
          <lb/>with it the Stone; after this he washes the Wound with Wine,
          <lb/>and dresses it with Lint and some glutinous Balsam. ;</p>
        <p rend="indent">If none of the Methods before propos’d prove successful for
          <lb/>extracting the Stone, as it often happens, when it js detain'd in
          <lb/>the Middle of the Urethra, and there is Danger, lest the Diffi-v
          <lb/>culty of Urine, with the mostintense Strainings to discharge it,
          <lb/>and the tormenting Pains, should, in a short time, destroy the
          <lb/>Patient, There .is but one Remedy left, and that is, to make an
          <lb/>Incision in that Part of the Penis where the Stone ledges, and,
          <lb/>by that means, extract it. The Manner of Operation is thus:
          <lb/>The Extremity os the Skin, as <hi>Celsius</hi> formerly advised, is Very much
          <lb/>drawn forwards; or, as others advise, retracted; and the Glans
          <lb/>being by tins means cover'd, - or laid bars, the Penis is ty'd behind
          <lb/>the Stone, in order to .prevent the Stone from being forc'd
          <lb/>- back by the Hands os the Operator, when apply'd upon the
          <lb/>Penis; The Operator then sets the Thumb of his Lest Pinger</p>
        <p>against the Stone, .in such a manner as to hinder it from giving
          <lb/>way forwards, and, .with his Right Hand, makes a strait Incision
          <lb/>in the Side os the Penis ; and then, with his Fingers, or
          <lb/>some Instrument, aS the Forceps, Probe, or Hook, pulls out
          <lb/>the Stone. This done, he Skin is set loose, and the Wound,
          <lb/>after being anointed with some proper vulnerary Balsam, is
          <lb/>cover'd with a Plaister.. By this Way of Management the sound .
          <lb/>Part of the Skin comes to cover the Incision in the Penis, the
          <lb/>Urine stows-the natural Way, and-the Conglutination os the
          <lb/>Wound is promoted. When a Wound requires to be made a
          <lb/>littie larger than ordinary,-the hest way is to introduce a Leaden
          <lb/>Pipe into the Urethra heyond the Wound, and to keep it there
          <lb/>for some time for the. Reception and Emission os the Urine.
          <lb/>For if this should he suffer'd to flow by the Wound, it is very
          <lb/>much to he fear’d, that its Acrimony would excite sharp Pains,
          <lb/>and an Inflammation, by which the Conglutination os the
          <lb/>Wound would be considerably retarded, and a Fistula might be
          <lb/>generated in the Urethra. But a Very good way to preserve the
          <lb/>Wound from the pernicious Effects of thc Ufine, is, to drink
          <lb/>Very sparingly sor some Days before and after the Operation. ,
          <lb/>As for making the Incision in the Side of the Penis, it is done
          <lb/>for Very good Reasons ; for,' if it were made in the under Part
          <lb/>os the Penis, the Wound would be much more liable to be incommoded
          <lb/>by the Urine ; and to make an Incision in the upper ,
          <lb/>Part would be Very unadvised, because os cutting the cavernous
          <lb/>Bodies of the Penis; whence an immoderate Haemorrhage,
          <lb/>besides other pernicious Consequences, might justly be sear'd.

          <lb/>was this: He took the Penis in his Lest Hand, and made an Incision

          <lb/>cavernous Body from the Urethra, in which he afterwards made
          <lb/>a strait Incision in the Place where the Stone was lodg'd, which
          <lb/>is commonly under the cavernous Body, and, extracting it with
          <lb/>rhe Hook or Forceps, he anointed the Wound with some glutinous
          <lb/>Balsam, and’ then applying Lint and Compresses, carefully
          <lb/>bound up the Whole with a Fillet.' By this Method, the
          <lb/>ensue Part of the cavernous Body is brought to oover the Incision
          <lb/>in the Urethra; and the Tips of the Wound, as they assert,

          <lb/>may judge what Situation it had kept during its Stay there).
          <lb/>He was much incommoded by it for eight Days, not-bring able
          <lb/>to fit without a Violent Pain ; and at length, in rising from his </p>
        <pb n="144"/>
        <p>Sent, perceived the whole Stone to come out. He came to
          <lb/><hi>La Charite</hi> the next Day, and gave me an Account of his Distemper,
          <lb/>producing the Stone, winch T preserve for the Rarity
          <lb/>of the Cose: It weighs an Ounce and fifteen Grains, is almost
          <lb/>of a triangular Figure, two inches and a half from one of the
          <lb/>Angles to each of the other two, and two Inches from each
          <lb/>Angle to the Sides subtending them, and three Quarters of an
          <lb/>Inch thick.</p>
        <p rend="indent">It seems surprising, that an extraneous Body should ledge so
          <lb/>long, without causing either Pain, or Difficulty in making
          <lb/>Water. By examining the Stone you may discover the Reason:
          <lb/>There is a Depression in it, on that Side next the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi>
          <lb/>and probably the Urine flow'd freely by it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tho' the Lips of the Wound, thro' which the Stone pass’d,
          <lb/>were approach'd, the Hole was still large enough to admit of
          <lb/>my Finger. I felt a large Cavity where the Stone had lodged,
          <lb/>winch was formed by a Dilatation of the Urethra; and I imagined,
          <lb/>at first, that the Stone, when it was small, came from
          <lb/>the Urethra thro' the Hole by which the former had pass'd, and
          <lb/>then had increased between the Urethra and the Skin ; but my
          <lb/>Finger undeceived me, and convinced me, thet it had grown
          <lb/>in the Urethra itself; for, besides seeling the whole Circumference
          <lb/>Very smooth, as it grew narrow, it guided my Finger
          <lb/>almost behind the Scrotum, where the Dilatation ended. The
          <lb/>dilated Urethra was Very thin in that Part where the Stone had
          <lb/>lodged, and a Callosity was to be felt on both Sides,- without
          <lb/>any Sinus. This Circumstance proves, that the Urethra was
          <lb/>not open’d, but when the Stone came out; for, if it hed heen
          <lb/>open'd before, the Urine would undoubtedly have form'd Sinuses
          <lb/>and Fistulas in several Parts of the Perinaeum, and here
          <lb/>we had none ; from whence I infer, that the Callosities at the
          <lb/>Side were occalion'd only by the Pressure os the Stone.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I had recourse to generous Remedies and Topics to dissolve
          <lb/>them, such aS emollient Cataplasms, applied to the <hi>Perineeum;</hi>
          <lb/>and that the Urine, by passing that Way, might not wet the
          <lb/>Flesh and the Dressings, and that it might not be lodged in the
          <lb/>Cavity from whence the Stone proceeded, I introduced an <hi>Algaly</hi>
          <lb/>into the Bladder, and there lest it. After I had used the Cataplasms
          <lb/>two or three Days, I substituted resolvent Plaisters in
          <lb/>their stead, and put small Dossiis into the Wound, cover'd
          <lb/>with melted Diachylon, with the Gums, and the Mucilageplainer.
          <lb/>All the Hardness decreased in less than three Weeks;
          <lb/>after winch I used only Injections, with Barley-water, and Vul*
          <lb/>nerary Water, every Day. But my Attempts were fruitless,

          <lb/>Instrument of his own Invention, for extracting a Stone out os

        <p rend="indent">While I was, says he, intent upon these Experiments on the
          <lb/>Calculus, it occui’d to my Thoughts, that large Gravelstones,
          <lb/>which often stack for several Days in the Urethra, to
          <lb/>the great Torment of the Patients, and which they cannot
          <lb/>sometimes he delivered from without cutting them out, might
          <lb/>' be drawn out by the following Instrument.</p>
        <p rend="hanging">I cut off the lower End of a strait Catheter, which made it
          <lb/>a proper Canula for a Stillet or Forceps to pass thro'; the lower
          <lb/>End of the Forceps was divided into two Springs, like Tweezers,.
          <lb/>whose Ends were turn'd a little inwards: These Springs
          <lb/>were made of such a Degree of Tenderness and Pliancy, as not
          <lb/>to bear too hard against the Sides of the Urethra, by their Dilatation.-
          <lb/></p>
        <p rend="indent">When this Instrument is used, the Springs are drawn up
          <lb/>within the Canula ; which being pass'd into the Urethra, as
          <lb/>sar as to the Stone, the Canula must then be drawn back, so
          <lb/>sar aS to give room for the Forceps to dilate ; which dilated
          <lb/>Forceps being then thrust down a little farther, so as to embrace
          <lb/>the Stone, then the Canula must again be (lid down, to make
          <lb/>the Forceps take fast Hold of the Stone, so as to draw it out.</p>
        <p rend="indent">I sent this Instrument to Mr. <hi>Ranby</hi> to heve his Opinion of
          <lb/>it, who tells me, Thet, upon repeated Trials, he found it extracts
          <lb/>these Stones with great Ease and Readiness; and that it is
          <lb/>io well approved of by other Surgeons, that many of them make
          <lb/>use of it.</p>
        <p rend="indent">This strait Instrument will, therefore, ferve to extract such
          <lb/>Stones as are lodged, aster they have pass’d the Turning at the

        <p><orth>AS</orth> the Bladder is subject to many other Disorders besides the
          <lb/>Stone, winch appear with Symptoms not unlike it, I shall give
          <lb/>the following Treatise from <hi>Hessenan</hi>, in which the Reader will
          <lb/>find his Account. - - .. τ</p>
        <p>The Bladder, as being a nervous and muscular Part of the
          <lb/>Body, is Very subject to Spasms; by which Word we under-stand
          <lb/>an intense and preternatural Constriction’ of the Body os
          <lb/>the Bladder, and also of the Sphincter ; or a Stricture, Coarctation,
          <lb/>and Crifpation of the Fibres, to which Disorder many
          <lb/>other morbouS Affections owe their Original.</p>
        <p>Those tormenting Pains which are excited by the long Continuance
          <lb/>of a Stone in the Bladder, together with a perpetual
          <lb/>Desire of making Water, and the very difficult and painful
          <lb/>Evacuation of the Urine, are owing to nothing but Spaiyns.
          <lb/>For a convulsive Stricture, which -affects not only the
          <lb/>Musculo-nervous Coat of the Bladder, but also its Sphincter,
          <lb/>and the Urethra itself, in a violent manner, excites a Strangury,
          <lb/>and so great aStraining in the Pubes, as if it were scarce possible
          <lb/>to stop the Urine, which yet, as soon as it begins to drop, is
          <lb/>?uite repressed and retain'd. This Disorder is attended with a
          <lb/>ain throughout the whole Region of the Penis, but oftentimes
          <lb/>only with a most acute Pain in the Glans, according to the Observations
          <lb/>of <hi>Hildanus</hi> and <hi>Baglivi</hi>. This extraordinary Sensation
          <lb/>of Pain, Itching, and continual Irritation, in the Glans
          <lb/>and Extremity of the Penis, is to be accounted one of the Pathognomic
          <lb/>Signs of the Stone, both in Boysand Men. But,*
          <lb/>besides this, there is also a frequent Define of going to Stool, or
          <lb/>a Tenesmus, because of the strict Connexion of the <hi>Intastinurfl
          <lb/>Rectum</hi> with the Bladder, and the Communication of the
          <lb/>Nerves. The Urine which comes off in this Dysury, is, for
          <lb/>the most part, white and foul, with a mucous Sediment ; for
          <lb/>the Convulsion of the muscular Fibres, by a violent Stricture
          <lb/>and Compression, squeezes out, from the interior mucous Coat
          <lb/>of the Bladder, a great Quantity of Viscid glutinous Lymph;
          <lb/>which, mix'd with the Urine, supplies that mucous Sediment.
          <lb/>Oftentimes also a thin, aqueous, and almost colourless Urine
          <lb/>Comes away from the Patient, while under this racking Pain,
          <lb/>and these Spasins, which, by mutual Consent and Communication
          <lb/>of Parts, penetrate to the very Ureters, and are the
          <lb/>Cause of their transmitting nothing but a thin and aqueous Substance,
          <lb/>convey'd from the Blood by the emulgent Vessels.
          <lb/>Moreover the Patiens, in making Water, often suffers very
          <lb/>severe Pains, sets his Legs across, compresses his Hips, bends
          <lb/>his Body forwards, and, with one Hand, sometimes with both;
          <lb/>presses with all his Might-upon his Belly near the Region of the
          <lb/>Pubes; and this gainful Evacuation of the Urine is attended
          <lb/>with Trembling, and, aS it were, convulsive Motions of the
          <lb/>whole Body, as is well observ'd by <hi>Vieussens</hi> in his <hi>Neurologia,
          <lb/>for</hi> the fine Nerves of the Bladder, heing Vellicated and conVulfed
          <lb/>in a Violent manner, by means of the intercostal Nerves;
          <lb/>communicate the same to the spinal Nerves, and so to all the .
          <lb/>other Parts. It is observ'd also, that, under a Strangury, and
          <lb/>a vehement Dysury, the Belly is constipated, and the Foeces,
          <lb/>together with the Flatulences, retain’d, which, when the Pain
          <lb/>ceases, readily resume their usual and natural Course:</p>
        <p rend="indent">It is certain also, from Observation, that all these recited'
          <lb/>Symptoms, and eVen worse, may be excited not only by a
          <lb/>Stone in the Bladder, but by a Stagnation os the Blood within
          <lb/>the Blood-Veffeis of that Part, the frequent Consequence of
          <lb/>which is a Violent inflammation. For it is a vulgar Error to
          <lb/>afcrihe all these Symptoms to a Stone in the Bladder, or art
          <lb/>Acrimony of Urine, since Observations and Dissections os dead
          <lb/>Bodies abundantly shew; that the Diseased have not only been
          <lb/>afflicted with the same Symptoms which proceed from a Stone
          <lb/>in the Bladder, but have undergone worse Torments; tho’
          <lb/>there has not been the least Sign os a Stone found in them aster,
          <lb/>their Death. For, as' when a Check iS given to the Course of
          <lb/>the Menses or Haemorrhoids, the Blood regurgitates upon
          <lb/>the Vesseis of the Stomach and Intestines ; and, stagnating within
          <lb/>their nervous and sensible Coats, by stretching and compressing </p>
        <pb n="145"/>
        <p>them,; excites violent Gripings, Anxieties, Pains, Convulsions,
          <lb/>and spasmodic Motions; so also, when thro’the D<hi rend="u">efaul</hi>t- or
          <lb/>Retention of the Haemorrhoids! Flux, or from any other Cause,
          <lb/>the .Blood is repelled in great Quantities upon the Body of the
          <lb/>Bladder, and there stagnates, no wonder.if, in such a sensible
          <lb/>Pass, it excites Spasms, and other consequent Symptoms.</p>
        <p rend="indent">t Thus a Suppression of the Haemorrhoidal Flux is sometimes
          <lb/>follow'd by bloody Urine, winch being stop’d, the Bladder is
          <lb/>seized with a Pain, Convulsions, and Inflammation. Sometimes
          <lb/>Women of a plethoric Habit os Body, when past their
          <lb/>fiftieth Year, aster a total Cesiation of the Catamenia, have
          <lb/>heen taken with terrible Convulsions os this kind, which heve
          <lb/>ended in a fatal Inflammation. For those who die of Diseases
          <lb/>osthe.Bladder, are destroy'd by an Inflammation and Sphacelus,
          <lb/>which are owing to a stubborn and fix'd Stagnation of the Blood
          <lb/>in. its Vessels, whereby their small Ramifications are too much
          <lb/>distended, and that in such a manner, that the Inflammation,
          <lb/>for the most part, affects not only the Bladder, but the <hi>Rectum;</hi>
          <lb/>the. Truth os which the Haemorrhoidal Vessels, being full of
          <lb/>black Blood, with the Lividness of the Penis, and the Veins in
          <lb/>the. Neck of the Bladder being Very much distended, and varicous
          <lb/>with Blood, sufficiently prove.</p>
        <p rend="indent">i There is but one principalCause of this mortal Inflammation,
          <lb/>and that is a strong Spasm of the Bladder, which the more violent
          <lb/>it is,To much the mure it increases the Stagnation and Detention
          <lb/>of the Blood in the Vessels, and hinders its Resolution.and
          <lb/>Discussion j whence it passes at last into an Abscess and Ulcer,,
          <lb/>and so becomes a chronical Disease, or degenerates into aSphacelus,
          <lb/>which soon destroys the Patient. And, indeed, this Violent
          <lb/>Convulsion of the Bladder, which is increased by the present
          <lb/>Inflammation, is- the Cause of a Multitude of dreadful Symptoms
          <lb/>with which an Inflammation is attended ; among winch,
          <lb/>according to.vfr/iusand <hi>Orihasius</hi>, area continual Fever, great
          <lb/>Heats, Pain, a burning Heat, and Tumor under the PeriItaeum,
          <lb/>and above the Pubes,, an Emission os Urine by Drops,
          <lb/>with great Difficulty, hard Strainings, and lamentable Cryingsout,
          <lb/>a frequent Stimulation to evacuate by Stool, attended at
          <lb/>last with Vomitings of Bile, a Pain of the Head, Thirst, Difficulty
          <lb/>os breathing. Redness os the Face and Eyes, a Tongue
          <lb/>black with parching Heat, obstinate want of Sleep, Delirium,
          <lb/>. Restlefness, Refrigeration of the extreme Parts, and at length</p>
        <p rend="indent">Death. There is a Passage in <hi>Hippoc. Lib. Pranocionum</hi>, concerning
          <lb/>the fatal Event of Diseases of the Bladder, which deserves
          <lb/>to be mention'd here. <hi rend="sup">tC</hi> Hardnesses and Pains of the
          <lb/>" Bladder are dreadful and pernicious in the utmost Degree,
          <lb/>" especially such as attend a continual Fever ; for the Pains
          <lb/>" themselves (these are the Effects of Convulsions) are sufficient
          <lb/>" to kill the Patient; and the Belly, at this time, makes no
          <lb/>" Excretions, but of a hard sort of Substance, and that forc'd.
          <lb/>" A Solution is attended with a Discharge of purulent Urine,
          <lb/>" depositing a white and thin Sediment. But if, aster such an
          <lb/>" Evacuation, the Pain be not mitigated, nor the Bladder
          <lb/>" mollisy’d, it is to be fear'd, that the Patient will die in the
          <lb/>" first Periods (περιόδοιοι) of the Distemper.""</p>
        <p rend="indent">These Symptoms which attend an Inflammation of the Bladder,
          <lb/>and discover themselves in various Parts of the Body, are,
          <lb/>indeed, very much to be dreaded ; and yet all os them, if well
          <lb/>consider'd, can hardly be ascrib'd to any other Couse than a
          <lb/>violent Spasm, which hegins in the Bladder, as being the Part
          <lb/>affected, and is thence communicated to the whole System of the
          <lb/>Nerves; for when a most violent Stricture and Crispation affect
          <lb/>the Fibres of the neighbouring Parts, which are the <hi>Intestinum
          <lb/>Rectum</hi>, and the <hi>Sphincter</hi> qf the <hi>Anus</hi>, there is either a
          <lb/>. continual Stimulation to Excretion, or so great a Constriction
          <lb/>of the <hi>Anus</hi>, that neither Foeces nor Flatus can be transmitted,
          <lb/>nor so much as a Clyster can gain Admission. And
          <lb/>since a strong Spasm is well known to debilitate the Part it long
          <lb/>affects, and leaves it at last in a State os Relaxation, the Consequence
          <lb/>is a Falling-out of the Anus, especially in aged Persons
          <lb/>and Infants. Whenever a severe Spasm of the Bladder extends
          <lb/>itself to the superior Parts, and particularly the intestines, it excites
          <lb/>Rumblings and Gripes, and, when it is communicated to
          <lb/>’ the Stomach, Loss of Appetite, ill Digestion, and Vomitings.</p>
        <p rend="indent"><hi>Celsius, Lib. y. C. isp</hi>. has a Very remarkable Paffaoe of the
          <lb/>Consent between the Bladder and the Stomach. "We know
          <lb/>" Very well, says he, that an Ulcer in the Bladder often as"
          <lb/>sects the Stomach, between which two Parts there is a kind of
          <lb/>" Sympathy. Hence it is, that the Food is not retain'd, or, if
          <lb/>" retain’d, is not concocted, nor the Body nourish'd." This
          <lb/>Convulsion also of the Bladder, which attends an Inflammation,
          <lb/>by affecting the Muscle of the Diaphragm, with the Nerves
          <lb/>and nervous Coats of the Lungs and Bronchia, causes a difficult
          <lb/>and troublesome Respiration, with an Anxiety of the Praecordia
          <lb/>; and being communicated to the Muscles of the Heart,
          <lb/>and the museulo-nervous Coats of the Arteries, makes a hard,
          <lb/>contracted, and quick Pulse, with a continual Fever, and an
          <lb/>unquenchable Thirst, which is, in like manner, owing to a
          <lb/>convulsiVe Stricture of the soft and glandulous Parts os the
          <lb/>Tongue and Fauces. But the Danger is still greater, if it extends
          <lb/>itself to the Membranes os the Brain, and the Origin of</p>
        <p>the Nerves ; for then a Constant want of Sleep, Delirium, Convulsions,
          <lb/>Refrigeration, and Horror os the extreme Parts, with an
          <lb/>unequal and intermittent Pulse, are Signs of approaching Death.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Tho' the Symptoms which proceed from a Stagnation and
          <lb/>Inflammation of the Blond, whether pure or impure,, in the
          <lb/>Bladder, are Very much to be dreaded, and often mortal; yet
          <lb/>those Disorders which arise from a salt, impure, and corrupted
          <lb/>Serum, obstinately adhering to, and vellicating the Goats of the
          <lb/>Bladder, are milder, and less dangerous. Of this Nature are
          <lb/>those Pains which attend a Difficulty of Urine, and a Strangury.
          <lb/>We Often meet with Cases of this kind among the ObserVations
          <lb/>of Physicians, particularly <hi>Drawitz</hi>, who deserves to be
          <lb/>remember'd, and who, about an Age ago, wrote an entire
          <lb/>Treatise, in the <hi>Gorman</hi> Tongue, concerning the Scurvy,
          <lb/>which is one of the best on the Subjecti In this Book he makes
          <lb/>several Observations, and describes Coses of Patients who complain’d
          <lb/>of racking Pains in the passing off of their Urine, the .
          <lb/>Cause of winch was no Defect, or Stone, in the Bladder, but.
          <lb/>only an impure scorbutic Humour. Among others, he relates a.
          <lb/>memorable Case of a Butcher, who had never labour'd under the
          <lb/>Stone, and was on a sudden taken with an intolerable Pain
          <lb/>in his Feet ; the Disease, heing remov'd from those Parts, was.
          <lb/>tranflated upon the Urethra, with an intense Heat, and Difficulty
          <lb/>of Urine, which scarce came away by Drops. This Disc
          <lb/>order yielded to Discutients, but return'd into the Feet, the
          <lb/>Consequence of which was a Tumor in those Parts.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We have often observ'd, in aged Persons, Disorders of the
          <lb/>Bladder, and especially a Difficulty of Urine, which have been
          <lb/>contracted by a sedentary Life, or a scorbutic Dyscrasy of the .
          <lb/>Humours, which, in old Age, is almost perpetual; and nothing
          <lb/>is more frequent,than,, upon a Cessation of the rheumatic
          <lb/>or gouty Pains, for the Patient to be afflicted with a Dysury,
          <lb/>winch, on the Return of those Pains, goes off spontaneoufly.
          <lb/>It is also a usual Observation, that scorbutic Persons, affected
          <lb/>with a chronical <hi>Purpura</hi>, or purple Eruptions, a Disorder Very
          <lb/>common in our Days, when, by a Cold, or some other Couse,
          <lb/>aS, for Instance, often repeated Bleeding, the Humour has been
          <lb/>retracted inwards, or remains within, are seiz'd with a great.
          <lb/>Difficulty foe Urine, an Anxiety about the Praecordia, a Restlesness,
          <lb/>want of Sleep, and an inward burning Heat; all which
          <lb/>Symptoms, upon the Expulsion of the <hi>Purpura</hi> to the Superficies
          <lb/>of the Body, Vanish andthsappear.</p>
        <p rend="indent">There is yet another Cause of the Spasms and Pain of the
          <lb/>Bladder, which is some Disorder in the Kidneys, whence,
          <lb/>sometimes, a purulent and Viscous Matter, at other times
          <lb/>Stones and Gravel, are transmitted by the Ureters to the Bladder.
          <lb/>In both Cases, unless the foreign Matter be timely expel'd,
          <lb/>st is capable of exciting Very dangerous Disorders, and
          <lb/>particularly most Violent Spasms. If the Matter be more
          <lb/>tenacious and acrimonious than ordinary, it adheres to the Inside
          <lb/>of the Bladder, and especially about its Neck, and excites
          <lb/>a Strangury, Dysury, Tenesmus, and Inflammation ; orsecretiy
          <lb/>and slowly corrodes the Membranes of the Bladder, and so renders
          <lb/>it exulcerated. If this Matter, by the Accession os other
          <lb/>Causes, become transform'd, and pass into the Nature os a
          <lb/>Stone ; or a Stone,, already made, descends from the Kidneys
          <lb/>into the Bladder; it is continually irritating the same by its
          <lb/>Roughness or Weight, and produces the same Disorders aS be-
          <lb/>sore-mention'd; and, in the latter Cose, the Bottom also, and
          <lb/>the Sides of the Bladder, especially where the Stone is large,
          <lb/>are exulcerated.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Sometimes the Neck of the Bladder is irritated, stretched,,
          <lb/>and convulsed, by other Causes besides those already mention'd ;
          <lb/>as, for example, when a Gonorrhea, whether of the mild or
          <lb/>malignant Sort, continues, <hi>for</hi> a song time together, in its
          <lb/>proper Seat, which is in the two Glandulae Prostatae, which are
          <lb/>contiguous to the Neck of the Bladder; for the Humour, in
          <lb/>this Space os Time, heing corrupted with the Venereal Impurity,
          <lb/>hecomes every Day more deprav'd, and generates Ulcers,.
          <lb/>sometimes but flight, sometimes of a more dangerous Nature,
          <lb/>or excites Inflammations in the affected Part. And if the Cure
          <lb/>of these Disorders happens to be ill perform’d, it is often ohserv'd,
          <lb/>that the next adjacent Parts are infected with the Contagion.
          <lb/>The Urine then comes off of a purplish Colour, and
          <lb/>a Scabies of the Bladder, and even an Exulceration of that Part,,
          <lb/>especially about the Neck, frequentiy succeed. Hence it is
          <lb/>that those who labour under a Virulent Gonorrhea, often discharge
          <lb/>a turbid Urine, winch deposits a good deal of a Viscid and
          <lb/>sanious Sediment.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Among the Causes of thiS dangerous Spasm of the Bladder,
          <lb/>may also he reckon'd, an Inflammation or Ulcer os the <hi>Intestinum
          <lb/>Rectum</hi>, or of the Penis ; an Abscess in any os the inner.
          <lb/>Parts of the Abdomen, which breaking, the Pus being discharg'd
          <lb/>into the Cavity os the Abdomen, makes its Progress at
          <lb/>last towards the Bladder; a Corruption of the Omentum ; an.
          <lb/>Effusion of Blond, however caused, into the Abdomen; the
          <lb/>Falling of the Water, in Dropsies, upon the Bladder ;. an Inflammation

        <p><orth>AS</orth> to the external Causes of this convulsive Distemper os the
          <lb/>.Bladder, we may suppose them to be Contusions, and Violent
          <lb/>Blows shout the <hi>Pubes</hi>, or <hi>Pcrinaum</hi>; an unskilful Section sor
          <lb/>the Stone, in which, thro' want of Dexterity in directing the
          <lb/>Knife, or extracting the Stone, especialsy if it he larger and
          <lb/>rougher than ordinary, the Cure os the Wound becomes dishcult,
          <lb/>and is attempted by improper Means ; a too careless introducing
          <lb/>of the Catheter, in order to search sor the Stone, or
          <lb/>in a Suppression of Urine, or for any other Reason, when the
          <lb/>Sphincter of the Bladder happens to he under a close Constriction,
          <lb/>or the Passage stop'd by a Tumor, Caruncle, Scirthus, or any
          <lb/>other Cause; the Section of a Fistula in Ano, where, for want
          <lb/>of Caution, the Sphincter of the Anus, winch is pretty closely
          <lb/>Connected with the Neck of the Bladder, happen'd to he incautioufly
          <lb/>tootrmch wounded, or due Care was not taken of the
          <lb/>Wound, in Women, a Cause may he hard Labour in Childbirth,
          <lb/>in which the Bladder, and especially its Neck, are often
          <lb/>-compressed and affected in such a manner, as to give Rise to an
          <lb/>.Ulcer and Fistula in those Parts, according to <hi>Mauriceau, Aphl</hi>285.
          <lb/>And here the remarkable Malignity of Cantharides,
          <lb/>- with respect to the Bladder, deserves our Notice ; for whether
          <lb/>taken inwardly, or outwardly apply'd, they heve heen certainly
          <lb/>.known, from Observations, to excite Spasms, Inflammations,
          <lb/>and Ulcers in that Part, of which .there are many Examples.
          <lb/>It appears also, from practical Observations, that
          <lb/>drinking of cold Water, after Section for the Stone, excites
          <lb/>Violent Spasms, or gives .Rise to a mortal Gangrene, or a
          <lb/>fistulous Ulcer.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Having assign'd the Causes of this spasmodic Affection of the
          <lb/>Bladder, we think ourselves oblig'd to account for a peculiar
          <lb/>Phenomenon, which is, why those Symptoms, such as a Difficulty
          <lb/>of Urine, attended with a Pain, and other concomitant
          <lb/>-Evils, should so miserably afflict the Patient only at Intervals,
          <lb/>tho' the material Cause, which is the Stone, or a scorbutic Dyscrasy,
          <lb/>be always present. The Reason seems to be this : All
          <lb/>Vehement Pains in a nervous sensible Pan, if they continue long,
          <lb/>induce and leave a Weakness and Relaxation, in which State the
          <lb/>Pains are no longer felt; but then this very Weakness is the
          <lb/>Cause of a. new Collection and Stagnation of impure Humours
          <lb/>fupply'd from other Parts of the Body; whence there is always a
          <lb/>Generation and Coacervation of fresh Matter, for rekindling
          <lb/>and reviving the Paroxysm. For Debility, as <hi>Celsius</hi> says, is
          <lb/>subject to all Diseases ; and therefore it may be establish'd as an
          <lb/>universal pathological Canon, That those Parts winch are debilitated
          <lb/>by the preceding Violence of aDistemper, are Very easily
          <lb/>. susceptible of the morbific Humour, which, after a gradual</p>
        <p rend="indent">Collection, either spontaneous, or excited by some flight
          <lb/>Cause, makes a fresh Attack upon the Patient ; and hence
          <lb/>may be deduc'd the true Original of periodical Affections.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We heve several times observ'd, that a Stone in the Bladder is
          <lb/>only at certain Intervals the Cause of many Disorders, such as
          <lb/>frequent and difficult Attempts to make Water, attended with a
          <lb/>scalding Heat and Pain, Gripes of the Belly, Coldness of the
          <lb/>extreme Parts, and a Decay of Strength, and that principally
          <lb/>when the North Wind blows, or aster flatulent Food, or
          <lb/>Beer not well defecated. Or from some unusual Commoxion
          <lb/>of the Mind, or too great a Refrigeration of the extreme
          <lb/>Parts, or customary Bleeding too long omitted. The
          <lb/>general Reason to be given sor the Return of those Disorders on
          <lb/>such Occasions, is, that all those things besore-mention’d as
          <lb/>Causes, are of such a Nature, and so qualified, as, partly by
          <lb/>suppressing the salutary Excretions, partly by augmenting the
          <lb/>Quantity of impure Humours, and propelling them towards the
          <lb/>weaker Part, to give Occasion for the Return of the Disease,
          <lb/>- with its usual Train of Symptoms, upon the Patient. It is
          <lb/>. often observed also, that Distempers of the Bladder are attended
          <lb/>with a flatulent Colic, especially when there is a hot and
          <lb/>painful Discharge of the Urine; and that all Aliments which
          <lb/>generate Inflations, exasperate the Disorders of the Bladder, as,
          <lb/>on the contrary, all Carminatives are beneficial.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Among Diseases of the Bladder, which are attended with
          <lb/>Spasms, may well be reckon'd discharging os bloody Urine,
          <lb/>which, however, does not all proceed from the Kidneys or
          <lb/>emulgent Veffeis, as Physicians usually imagine, but often
          <lb/>flows proximately and immediately from the Blood-Veffeis
          <lb/>of the Bladder, and especially the ruptur’d Branches of the external
          <lb/>haemorrhoids! Vein. This Haemorrhage, attending the</p>
        <p rend="hanging">Urine, may he known to proceed from the Veffeis of theBladder,
          <lb/>by a Difficulty of Urine, a burning Heat, and Tenesmus
          <lb/>affecting the <hi>Anus</hi>, convulsive Motions about the <hi>Glans</hi>, a pungent
          <lb/>Pain from the <hi>Glans</hi> to the <hi>Pertitaum</hi>, a rigid Tension of
          <lb/>the <hi>Penis</hi>, with Rumblings and Flatulencies in the Abdomen,
          <lb/>Loss ofAppetite, and frequent Eructations; aS also, if the bloody
          <lb/>Urine, and concomitant Symptoms, after bleeding in the Foot,</p>
        <p rend="hanging">and Apphcation of Leeches to the Anus, are remitted and
          <lb/>cease. And, indeed, tho' such bloody Urine does not so Very
          <lb/>frequentiy proceed immediately from the Bladder, yet it haS
          <lb/>heen sometimes observed, and particularly by <hi>Hoechstettcr,
          <lb/>Dear</hi>. 1. <hi>Schol, in Cas</hi>. 2. Sometimes pure Blond comes off</p>
        <p>with the Urine, Or, instead thereof. Urine of a brown Colour,
          <lb/>like Coffee; as we observed in a Man eighty Years os Age,
          <lb/>whenever he rode on Horseback - Tho Urine, when cold, deposited
          <lb/>a dense and red Sediment.</p>
        <p>Dreadful Symptoms also usually happen from concreted
          <lb/>Blood within the Bladder, as <hi>Lommius</hi> observes, fuch as fre-.
          <lb/>quent Paintings, a Difficulty of Breathing, a low, small, and
          <lb/>quick Pulse, a great Nausea, Anxiety of Spirit, and a cold
          <lb/>Sweat, with art universal ImhecillitV, Paleness os Countenance,
          <lb/>and Refrigeration of the extreme Parts ; all which Symptoms
          <lb/>are to be ascribed to a violent convulsive Stricture, communicated
          <lb/>to the whole nervous System. A Condensation of Blond
          <lb/>in the Bladder is also the Cause os racking PainS, with a vehement
          <lb/>Heat at the Bottom of the <hi>Pubes</hi>, and about the <hi>Penis,</hi>
          <lb/>which have been observed to cease aster the Patient had Voided
          <lb/>large, oblong, grumous Concretions of Blood in his Urine. As
          <lb/>to the Cure of bloody Urine, which proceeds from an affected
          <lb/>Bladder, <hi>Lommius</hi> rightly judges, that it is more difficult than
          <lb/>when it descends from the superior Parts;</p>
        <p rend="indent">We must not omit to observe, that a Spasm of the Bladder,
          <lb/>which excites a Strangury and Dysury, especially in old, scorbutic,
          <lb/>and cacochymical Constitutions, may proceed also from
          <lb/>a Very salt Urine, impregnated with acrid, tartarous, salinosulphureous,
          <lb/>and muddy excremen titions Parts : For the Urine
          <lb/>is sometimes found so salt as to corrode the Tongue, and, <hi rend="u">as</hi> it
          <lb/>distiis from the Urethra, to excoriate the neighbouring Parts;
          <lb/>and therefore, if it should happen to stagnate for a considerable.
          <lb/>Time in the Bladder, will, by vellicating the Fibres of
          <lb/>the Nerves, close up the Sphincter, and streighten the Urethra,
          <lb/>and, by tearing and corroding the Membrane, excite most intolerable
          <lb/>Pains, if, after a painful Discharge of the Urine;
          <lb/>there appear in it branny littie Masses, with Plenty of flender
          <lb/>Filaments, which subside, the Antients call this Affection a
          <lb/><hi>Scabies os</hi> the Bladder ; because it indicates a Corrosion of the
          <lb/>mucous and Villous Membrane thereof.</p>
        <p rend="indent">We said before, that a Stone, contain'd in the Bladder, is
          <lb/>often the Occasion of strong and painful Convulsions, attended
          <lb/>with a Difficulty os Urine, which molest the Patient at InterVais;
          <lb/>but we are also to take Notice, that Spasms of the Bladder,
          <lb/>when proceeding from other Causes, frequently lay the
          <lb/>first Foundation fur the Generation and Concretion os the Stone
          <lb/>in the Bladders.. This principally happens in old Men, who are
          <lb/>of a plethoric Constitution, addicted to a sedentary Lise, and,
          <lb/>on account of a weak Perspiration, commonly Void a highcolour'd
          <lb/>Urine, saturated with tartarous muddy Scoriae: For
          <lb/>the Spasm excites a Dysury; and the urinous Liquor, being retain'd
          <lb/>a littie longer than ordinary, deposits a tenacious glutinous
          <lb/>Matter, which, heing involved in tartarous Salts, may
          <lb/>be supposed the first Principles os a calculous Concretion hereafter
          <lb/>to be form'd ; unless the Matter be evacuated by some
          <lb/>convenient Medicine, and a free Passage made for the Urine by
          <lb/>removing the Spasm.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Of all Diseases of the Bladder, a violent Stricture is most dangerous,
          <lb/>and often mortal, especially when it is attended with
          <lb/>a Vehement Pain, an acute Fever, with an Hardness of the
          <lb/>Bladder appearing near the <hi>Pubes</hi>, Costiveness, and a Suppress
          <lb/>sion of Urine, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>Prognostics</hi>, and
          <lb/>his <hi>Coacee Pranotiones</hi>, where he says, " That a Hardness and
          <lb/>" Pain in the Bladder are Very bad Symptoms upon all Ac"
          <lb/>counts, but worst when attended with a continual Fever,
          <lb/>" for the.Pain alone is sufficient to kill the Patient. There
          <lb/>." is but little Evacuation, by Stool, under this Distemper."</p>
        <p rend="indent">If the Pain and Hardness are but moderate, and without an
          <lb/>acute Fever, the Inflammation is of a mild Nature. The
          <lb/>Event, in such Cases, is Various; sometimes the Disease is critically
          <lb/>resolved, by the cutaneous Eruption of an Erysipelas ;
          <lb/>sometimes it tends to a Suppuration, in which Case there comes
          <lb/>away purulent Urine, which deposits a thin white Sediment;
          <lb/>If there be a plentiful Discharge of the Urine with <hi>Pus,</hi>
          <lb/>the Tumor subsides, the Bladder is molliry'd, the Fever mitigated,
          <lb/>and a free Passage made for the Excrements. The
          <lb/>worst Event is, when the Distemper degenerates into a mortal
          <lb/>Sphacelus. <hi>Hossenan, Medic. Rat. System</hi>,</p>
        <p><hi>The</hi> CURE.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Having consider’d the many severe and dangerous Disorders
          <lb/>proceeding from painful Spasms of the Bladder, Urethra, and
          <lb/>adjacent nervous Parts, with respect to the different Nature of
          <lb/>their Causes, we now come briefly to propose and explain the
          <lb/>most convenient Methods and Remedies for the Relief of the
          <lb/>Patient. If we find the Disease approaching, or at least are
          <lb/>apprehensive of its coming, and that it proceeds from a Redundande
          <lb/>of Blood, especially in old Persons of a Vigorous Constitution,
          <lb/>who have for a long time pass'd their Lives without
          <lb/>sufficient Motion of Body ; the greatest Relief, in such a Case,
          <lb/>is to he expected from speedy and plentiful Bleeding, which
          <lb/>hecomes the more necessary, if the Cause is suspected to be a

        <pb n="147"/>
        <p rend="indent">Flux, or an Omission of long accustom'd Phlebotomy, or

          <lb/>with the Stone, seems to savour-this Opinion.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Upon this Occasion I cannot omit a beautiful Observation
          <lb/>of <hi>Boerhaave</hi>, who, speaking of Menstruums, says thus ; The’
          <lb/>earthy Bodies, when corroded by Acids, may he dissolv’d in
          <lb/>Water, Alcalies, when intimately united with Earth, cannot
          <lb/>be afterwards dissolv’d with Water, ’ as plainly appears in Glass,
          <lb/>which consists of an Alcali, and an Earth, intimately united,
          <lb/>and is less soluble in Water, the closer the Union; So great is
          <lb/>the Difference between the Solution os' Earth by one kind of
          <lb/>Salt and another. Alcalies, we see, subtilely dissolve Earth into
          <lb/>a fix’d, transparent, bard Body, which resists the dissolving.
          <lb/>Power of Water, more than any other Body ; but it- appears
          <lb/>stranger still, that the subtile, volatile, alcaline Salts of Animils,
          <lb/>intimately united with Earth, should form a Mass ondissolvable
          <lb/>in helling Water ; for the Stones generated in Animais
          <lb/>I take to consist of these two Principles and Oil ; and
          <lb/>in whatever Part of the Body such Stones are generated, they
          <lb/>commonly produce terrible Effects i as having a Power of attracting
          <lb/>and joining to themselves a similar Matter, from such
          <lb/>Animal Juices as approach nearest to Putrefaction, as the Bile
          <lb/>and Urine , which containing Salts nearly alcaline, these Salts
          <lb/>unite to themselves the fine Earth, -wore off from the Parts of
          <lb/>the Body; and thus lay the Foundation os new Stones,- or onlarge
          <lb/>the old ones; and hence the daily Increase of this monstrous
          <lb/>Production, which brings on terrible Disorders.</p>
        <p rend="indent">Hence we may perhaps deduce the Reason, why the Auther
          <lb/>of Nature has made nearly all the Aliments-of Animais incline
          <lb/>to Acidity ; for the acid Salts, on this Account, predominating
          <lb/>in the Stomach, dispose such Aliments to dissolve
          <lb/>. more easily, whose firmer Parts cohere principally by means of
          <lb/>Earth ; whence they would otherwise with much more Difficulry
          <lb/>be dissolv'd into fluid Chyle. But when afterwards a
          <lb/>Matter is to he form’d of this Chyle, fit to bind the Solids together,
          <lb/>the Tendency to Acidity, which was necessary in the
          <lb/>Chyle, is changed, and analcaline Tendency of the Salts introduced;
          <lb/>which, by binding the earthy Particles, forms a
          <lb/>Struilure indissoluble inWater, and fit to resist the Action of the
          <lb/>Fluid. At least we know, that Bones remain solid and firm, if
          <lb/>steep’d in Alcalies; hut grow foft and flexible, if detain’d in
          <lb/>Acids; as rhe ingenious Mr. <hi>Ruyseh</hi> has often assur’d me, he
          <lb/>found in his Anatomical Experiments. And doubtless, -when
          <lb/>the Power of changing Acefcents into Alcalles is wantiog in
          <lb/>the Body, the Bones, Cartilages, Teeth, and Ligaments, become

          <lb/>Compliment to the Understanding and Honour of many Gentlemen
          <lb/>. of known Integrity, who were appointed by Parliament
          <lb/>to inspect into,, and who afterwards gave their Opinion
          <lb/>in Favour of, these Medicines.</p>
        <p rend="indent">My third Reason is, Thet I have known in several Instances,
          <lb/>great Effects produc'd by a Medicine, which seems to be nearly
          <lb/>os the same Nature with those of Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>, as it confists
          <lb/>of Lime made of Oyster-shells. The History os it, so sar
          <lb/>as I am acquainted with it, is thus. Mr. <hi>Scbwemberg</hi>, a <hi>German</hi>'
          <lb/>Gentieman, extremely well Versed in the most abstruse Operations
          <lb/>of Chymistry, has a Method os melting, by the Help
          <lb/>of a Flux, calcin’d Oyster-shells, so as to make them run like
          <lb/>Wax, and to admit of being cast into Cakes, which dissolve
          <lb/><hi>por Deliquium</hi> into a Fluid; this, when filtred, is limpid as
          <lb/>Rock-water, and extremely alcaline, tho' not corrosive ; and,
          <lb/>which is pretty surprising, will, upon the Astisston of an
          <lb/>Acid, be entirely converted into a Snow-white Powder.
          <lb/>Twenty-five or thirty Drops of this Liquid, taken twice a
          <lb/>Day in Water, I haVe frequently known -to afford great Relief
          <lb/>in nepbritic Disorders.</p>
        <p rend="indent">My fourth Reason is. That a Lixivium of Lime will dissolve
          <lb/>human Stones, when out of the Body.</p>
        <p rend="indent">My fifth Reason iS, That Lime seems to be, in general, a
          <lb/>powerful Dissolver of earth, and earthy Concretions. Thus
          <lb/>Lime produces a great Fertility, when herd upon the most barren
          <lb/>kinds of Land, as Gravel; that is, it helps to dissolve the</p>
        <p>large Particles of Earth, and prepares it for furnishing Mattei
          <lb/>fora subsequent Vegetation. Hence it happens, that what
          <lb/><hi>Bocrhaave</hi> remarks in the P<hi rend="u">assag</hi>e quoted above,. in reg<hi rend="u">ard</hi>, to
          <lb/>Alcalies uniting with Earth, and rendering jt indissoluble, does
          <lb/>not hold good with respect to the Salt -of Lime, which is an
          <lb/>Alcali <hi>sui gencris</hi>, and in’ many Instances different, as to its
          <lb/>Properties, from all others. See CALx. .<space type="tab"> </space>τε.</p>
        <p>I shall conclude this Article with remarking,, that; as, in all
          <lb/>Cases whatever, the principal Duty <hi>os</hi> a. Physician consists in
          <lb/>diffinguishing accurately one Distemper froni another; so, particulariy
          <lb/>with respect to the Stone, he must take .careurot to be
          <lb/>deceived ; for there are three Distempers, which mimic so exactly
          <lb/>the Stone of the Kidneys, Ureters, and sometimes even
          <lb/>of the Bladder, that-It is not easy for a Person, not well versed
          <lb/>in these things, to distinguish some Symptoms of these from
          <lb/>the genuine Stone; I mean the Gout, latent intermitting Fevers,
          <lb/>and Hysterics. And, indeed, it is of great Importance,
          <lb/>in the Practice of Physic, to distinguish the Symptoms
          <lb/>caused by. these three Distempers, when they seize upon
          <lb/>any of the Viscera, from the genuine Disorders to which the
          <lb/>Part is otherwise subject; for the Kidneys, Ureters, and
          <lb/>Bladder, are not the only Parts subject to their irregular Attacks.
          <lb/></p>
        <p>As to the Gout, when it fixes upon tho Region of the Kidneys
          <lb/>and Loins, and imitates the Stone, or when it affects the
          <lb/>Neck of the Bladder, it must be distinguish'd from the Stone,
          <lb/>by carefully comparing the Patient's Complaints with the Symptoms
          <lb/>of the genuine Stone above enumerated ; in which I have
          <lb/>been designedly Very full, and given them from different, and
          <lb/>those the best. Authors, that they maybe View'd in every Light.
          <lb/>The Constitution of the Patient is also to be taken into Consideration,
          <lb/>which, if gouty, gives an useful Hint to the Physi-l
          <lb/>cian; and the Unsuccessfulness of Remedies, which usually relieVe
          <lb/>in the Stone, lay a strong Suspicion, that the Disorder may
          <lb/>heve another Cause. <hi>See the Quotation above from</hi> Hoffman.</p>
        <p rend="indent">As to Hysterics imitating the Stone, <hi>Sydenham</hi> has observ'd,
          <lb/>and since him, I believe, every Physician concern'd in much
          <lb/>Practice, that sometimes this Disease seizes one of the.Kidneys,
          <lb/>where, hy the Violent Pain it occasions, it entirely resembles a
          <lb/>Fit of the Stone, not only with respect to the kind os Pain,
          <lb/>and the Part affected, but likewise by the violent Vomiting
          <lb/>wherewith it is accompanied, and the Pains extending thro
          <lb/>rhe whole Duct os the Ureter: So that 'tis hard to distinguish,
          <lb/>whether the Symptoms are from the Stone, or an Hysteric Diss,
          <lb/>order; unless, perhaps,"someMisfortune having depressed the
          <lb/>Woman's Spirits, a littie before the Disorder came on, or the
          <lb/>Discharge of green Matter by Vomit, should shew that the
          <lb/>Symptoms are rather to be ascrib'd to an hysteric Disorder than
          <lb/>the Stone. The Bladder also is occasionally affected with this
          <lb/>delusory Symptom, causing Pain, and a Suppression os Urine,
          <lb/>aS in the Case of an Obstruction of the urinary Passages from
          <lb/>a Stone. This last Species rarely happens, but the former
          <lb/>more frequently. Both usually attack such Women as are
          <lb/>greatiy debilitated by frequent hysteric Fits. <hi>Sydenham</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent">The Constitution of the Patient, and the Symptoms, are
          <lb/>to be accurately consider'd in this Case, aS well aS in nephritie
          <lb/>Symptoms proceeding from the Gout. This Disorder I
          <lb/>have frequently known instantly remov'd by Bleeding, without
          <lb/>any ill Consequences, notwithstanding the Cautions given
          <lb/>by some practical Writers against bleeding in Hysterics. See

        <p rend="indent"><orth>AS</orth> to intermitting Fevers imitating the Stone,' and other
          <lb/>Disorders, it is remarkable, that the general Use of the <hi>Peru.,
          <lb/>vian</hi> Bark has introduc’d many anomalous Symptoms of these
          <lb/>Fevers utterly unknown to the Antients. . These Irregularities
          <lb/>were,’ so far as I know, first taken Notice of by <hi>Morton, in</hi>
          <lb/>his most excellent Dissertation, <hi>de P rot siser mi Febris intcrmisu
          <lb/>tentis Genio y</hi> where there are many important Observations, so
          <lb/>strictly genuine and true, that a Physician must have practis'd
          <lb/>to Very littie Purpose, is he has not almost daily observ’d Cases
          <lb/>which strongly confirm them. It seems as if the Bark, by stifling,
          <lb/>and not carrying off the Disorder, leaves in the Blood
          <lb/>a Portion of the morbific Matter, which causes the Fever; or
          <lb/>which, to use the Language of <hi>Sydenham</hi>, Nature raises a Fever,
          <lb/>in order to expel. Now this is, in the Course os tho Circulation,
          <lb/>convey'd to, and deposited upon, one or other of the
          <lb/>Viscera, there causing the Symptoms which are raised by any
          <lb/>other Obstructions, or spasmodic Constrictions, in the same Part;
          <lb/>Hence Fevers, which have been treated with the Bark, frequently
          <lb/>afflict the miserable Patient for many Years, from
          <lb/>time to time, under the Mash of other Disorders. But, to -do
          <lb/>Justice to a Remedy now in so great Reputation not altogether
          <lb/>undeservedly, I must confess, that these irregular Symptoms
          <lb/>sometimes precede its Exhibition, and even constitute the very
          <lb/>first Scene of the Tragedy, before the Fever has shewn itself
          <lb/>to be what it really is:</p>
        <p rend="indent">In order to distinguish these Cases, regard is to be had to
          <lb/>the genuine Symptoms attending Disorders os the Part affected,
          <lb/>to the Constitution, and the Inefficacy of Remedies which </p>
        <pb n="151"/>
        <p>usually relieve. If a PeVcr has Preceded, which was treated
          <lb/>with the Bark, the’ many Years hesore, it lays a Foundation
          <lb/>for suspecting that to he the latent Cause, especially if it has frequently
          <lb/>returned, and as osten been treated with the Barin
          <lb/>But if a Sediment of a Pink-colour subsides to the Bottom of the
          <lb/>Urine, or the Pain is periodical, it puts the Case out of Diss
          <lb/>pure.’ It often, however, happens, that tho’a latent Fever is
          <lb/>the Cause of the Complaints, yet at first there is no Separation
          <lb/>in the Urine, nor do the Symptoms recur at any regular Pe".
          <lb/>riods; but, after prudent Evacuations, the Periods generally
          <lb/>hecome more regular, and the Disease betrays its Family by
          <lb/>the Sediment above described. The Method, therefore, is to
          <lb/>take away some Blood ; aster this, to give one lenient Purge,
          <lb/>or more, if necessary. The Alteratives should consist princi-</p>
        <p>pally of neutral Salts, either natural, as Nitre, or artificial, as
          <lb/>Juice of Lemons with Salt of Wormwood, disus'd Vinegar
          <lb/>with volatile Sal Ammoniac, and some <hi rend="u">simp</hi>le Water as a Vehide,
          <lb/>and an Addition of a proper Syrup to make it agreeable ;
          <lb/>the <hi>Terra Foliata Tartari</hi>, Otherwise call’d <hi>Tartarus Regencraius</hi>
          <lb/>5 <hi>Tartarus Tartarifatus</hi> ; but, above all, the <hi>Tartarus Vitrsu
          <lb/>olatus</hi>, perfectly neutraliz'd, according to Ἔςπὸσσϋε’δ Method.
          <lb/>Such a Treatment will very seldom fail to make the Disorder,
          <lb/>if caused by an Intermitting Fever, appear in its proper Form ;
          <lb/>and then the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, if it should be judged proper, will
          <lb/>generally cure.it; or a Continuation of the same neutral Salts,
          <lb/>with lenient Purges, intercalated at proper Intervals, will <hi>generally</hi>
          <lb/>perform a Cure, especially if assisted with Blisters, if neceffary,
          <lb/>and nothing forbids their Use. '</p>
